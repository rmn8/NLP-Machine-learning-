  mostly terrible, but still watchable with some laughs. Ladies will enjoy the stripper,Justin Hartley, who has a nice part with some great dance moves.(John Cena would have been good too; wonder if he was under consideration). The visiting Moms got on my nerves after a while. Movie felt very "forced" and most laughs were quiet ones. Only 8 people in the theater.
  MY CREAM-OF-THE-CROP CHOICE for 2016: 'MOONLIGHT'Storytelling, continuity, unpredictability, but the best ingredient ever: the casting. The director chose each of three actors based on their eyes - not their faces. It worked really well. I bathed in this film. It crept under my skin. It ripped my heart out and then placed it back inside my chest but operating just a bit 'better' if you will. Stunning. It really helped that I went into the theater not knowing a thing about the plot - or sub-plot. Like reveling in a good meal with the perfect wine to accompany it, 'Moonlight' just was the best entrée I filled my soul with in the fall of 2016, and it may just be my favorite film ever.
  Perfect Christmas viewing, fantastic film which i never tire of seeing. Christmas doesn't start till i have watched this.
  Freaky fantasy feature for frivolous fun. If the quirky dwarfs don't get to you, the droning film itself just might. Country bumpkin Dorothy and her weather-beaten house are lifted in a tornado only to land "over the rainbow" and right on top of a witch. Enter the "munchkins" (dwarves) who advise Dorothy to travel to the county's biggest city with a stupid scarecrow, an effeminate tin-man, and a slobbering lion (her "friends"). Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing, Dorothy returns to her home and realizes that everything she could ever want in life is right there on her farm, except for a job, a car, and any opportunity to have something resembling an exciting life. Over-rated film; mostly for kids.
  It was really fun to watch if you in the mood for little dialog
  i liked the witty dialogue and jokes and the action was heaps good
  we all know the legend of King Arthur I've been in love with the lore since I was a kid this movie does a good job of standing out among the countless others I applaud this movie for showing Arthur hidden away and raised from humble beginnings the movie however seems to stray away from the Legend of it too much times and it comes as a disappointment that many of the more interesting characters in The Legend are barely touched upon at times it feels like a sophisticated crime movie disguised in Arthurian garb with a hint of Lord of the Rings here and there still the movie is very enjoyable and makes King Arthur a character that the viewer can relate to the lead actor is amazing and The Supporting Cast is equally as impressive hoping for a sequel as I would love to see the legend continue definitely buying this on Blu-ray and would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys the Arthurian Legend or a great action adventure film
  Not worthy of the Oscar for best picture
  Beautiful, sensitive and sad. I think it's a masterpiece.
  Cheesy and over acted
  Hot garbage for the Holidays season, I'd rather get a lump of coal rather than see this again.
  Fan of the franchise, has some moments that are just for the Anime fans, the plot is kind of weak but the movie at a hole is not as bad as I was hopping from Hollywood
  Amazing group of actors.
  One of those examples of a movie that gets so much right - and what it gets right is SO good (great costume design and visual effects) -, but still gets overlong, exhausting and dull. It is just busy/noisy/imaginative enough to distract you from the drab storytelling core. It moves fast, which hides its lack of drama - there's no tension here, just lots of stuff happening. It's as though Guy Ritchie binge-watched Game of Thrones and then thought to himself, "Hey, I can do that!" To which I reply, "No, Guy. No you can't." Astonishingly, this film was originally conceived as being the first part of a potential six-film franchise, though I have serious doubts that it will do well enough to rate even a second installment. It's a mess graced by a few terrific sequences, but a mess nonetheless.
  So the bad moms are back! And now they will see their parents are they going to have fun with them and have a good Christmas with there family well I will leave that to you to find out, but such a funny movie I keep laughing a lot when I saw this movie! You know it would be great if they made a SQL!!
  Outstanding and touching!
  George Miller showed us a definition of what an "action movie" is and what a "practical work" is from this film. Not only the film was a feast to the eyes but also a feast to the ears. An action film that will be remembered for a long time
  It is not surprising how the critical notes and the normal users are different moonllight is a film difficult to understand often with a heavy tone even for a drama in this type, and it is very gratifying to see the evolution of chiron during the 3 acts Of the film all three actors that interprets it are many good, carry with themselves the weight and the motivations of the character but they are never equal that leaves the special film since the acting until the boy that stars in the first part of the film is phenomenal, The performances in general are perfect the soundtrack composed by classical music is phenomenal and the evolution of the plot is very good, the film shows what it is like to be a man in black society prejudice, homosexuality, and how two people can follow similar paths but a lot Different at the same time, a great deserving of the Oscar who won, note 100
  Don't mind the critics. The Users have it correct. This is an amazing story, well told by one of the best directors of our day. Visionary blending of myth, legend and historical fiction into a contemporary tale. Blown away. Way better than I expected. 5 Stars.
  It's gorgeously shot, but at the end of the day, even an all-in Kate Winslet performance can't save this tired, clunky melodrama.
  Love it! Beautiful movie!
  George Miller's Mad Max Fury Road has put modern action films to shame. With gorgeous wide shots of destruction, a near constant sense of urgency, good characters and a suprisingly solitd story, Mad Max Fury Road will be one of the gold standards for action movies for years to come.
  I know I wasn't supposed to love it but I accidentally did.
  Slow-moving, boring and pointless. Just because a movie aspires to show lives too rarely seen in cinema does not mean it succeeds. Also, the acting is terrible.
  Through a mix of magnificent visual effects, astonishing action sequences, and memorable characters, Mad Max: Fury Road gives us one of the best action films of all time.
  Awesome movie, not great work superb by George Miller.
  Totally ridiculous, not worth the time spent viewing.
  The movie was slow and boring. To think this could have won best pic of the year is utterly amazing! It is different, I'll give it that, but one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
  Excellent interpretation of the originals. Different of course, it is live action. ScarJo is perfect and delivers a VG performance as usual.
  Mahershala Ali indeed has a good performance in this, but the real stars in my mind are the different actors who play Chiron. They do an amazing job of portraying how he changes through his life, yet each version is recognizable as the same person.
  I love watching the classics and actually seeing every reason it's a classic in the first place. Some classics make me question the sanity of the people who made them, but luckily The Wizard of Oz deserves its title.No need for an extensive review, honestly. Everything was great. The performances were wonderful, the story was brilliantly adapted, and the music was just delightful. So many iconic images, moments, and words, a whimsical fantasy land, special effects (COLOR!) that had audiences in 1939 screaming and cheering. Such a fun watch, I can't get over it. I highly recommend you let yourself experience this beautiful film. I can't wait to watch it with my grandkids someday. 10/10 Bye love you
  Awesome and beautiful!!
  There and back again, a mute's tale.
  how they took such great story and turned it to this..........sad
  Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) C-120m. ?? D: George Miller. Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, Hugh Keays-Byrne. Loud, headache-inducing Mad Max adventure (fourth after BEYOND THUNDERDOME) follows relentless rebellion against disgusting tyrannical ruler in post-apocalyptic Australia with help of (mostly inaudible) loner Hardy. Lots of fireworks but little magic; hard to care about a movie with such perfunctory characterizations and plodding, unimaginative story. Super-production but lack of humanity hurt the effort. Larger in scale than other films in series, but bigness doesn't equal greatness. Great names, though: Rictus Erectus, Toast the Knowing, etc.
  Just got done watching this movie with my family... I'm not sure I understand what the critics expect but this movie was good and wholesome. It had a good story line,no language,and had morals for a change.I would recommend this to anyone who wants a change from the vulgarity that Hollywood usually puts out.
  Es una obra maestra, el desarrollo de personajes es tan bueno que podría haber una secuela de cada uno de ellos. En especial de Furiosa que rápidamente se ha convertido en las mejores heroínas de los 2000.
  One sometimes wonders what the point of making such a movie is and why it was made. This is one such film. I felt gritty after watching it. Like I'd been dragged through the sand.
  A truly wondrous sight to behold. Groundbreaking and timeless.
  Good Movie!! Great set up for a sequel!
  I do believe in spooks. I do believe in spooks. I do! I do! I do! I do believe in spooks. I do believe in spooks. I do! I do! I do! I do!
  Amazing movie. Loved it.
  i can't believe it win!! i didn't like it at all!!
  From start to the end this movie is pure, unstoppable adrenaline rush thats take no prizoners. basing whole movie on practical effects makes all the insane action more reall then in any other movie. This is 100% pure action movie that knows it and its here to deliver fun and excitment.
  Ironically more amusing than its highly modernized prequel (2013 movie). You just have to understand the lack of technology back then.
  I have a theory that this movie has probably been seen by more people than any other movie. The fact that it comes to us as children is probably the reason why. Other films like 'Gone With the Wind', 'Citizen Kane', 'The Godfather', 'Star Wars', have been seen by a lot of people but in each case I can imagine people that might not have seen them. In the case of 'The Wizard of Oz' it's hard to imagine anyone who might not have seen it at some point in their lives. Almost everyone you talk to has a memory of their first experience. The reason this movie remains the most beloved of Hollywood films even after six decades is because 'The Wizard of Oz' is unique among motion pictures in that it mirrors our longings and imaginations as children.The movie, in front of and behind the scenes, has become movie folklore. We love the legends about the rotating directors, from George Cukor to King Vidor to Victor Fleming. We know the legend of Buddy Ebsen who had to drop out due to an allergic reaction to the Tin Man makeup and Margaret Hamilton whose dress caught fire and nearly had her face burned off because of the copper-based make-up. We love stories about the problems on the set between personal feuds, sweltering costumes, partying munchkins and the costume designer who had to keep up with Judy Garland's developing bust line. There's even a spurious legend of a ghost on the set. All of these elements make 'The Wizard of Oz' a much bigger legend than it already it, but that's okay because this is the one movie that deserves to be over-hyped. It occupies such a large part of our memories that we want to make it more than it is, to just have one more reason to make it more than a movie, we want it to be a life experience.That experience is brought to us because we are intimately familiar with its story elements. The dreams that Dorothy sings about and the adventure that follows seem to mirror our yearnings as children. She imagines a bigger place where her problems don't linger and she is free to explore them. She imagines a place where there isn't any trouble and people actually listen to what she has to say. She sees the rainbow as her golden gate to a better place because in her drab Kansas world, the rainbow is the only source of color that she knows. She dreams of a bigger place and imagines a world where troubles melt like lemondrops. We can relate. How many of us as kids sat in our room or in our yards and played, imagining a place to go and characters to interact with, a colorful world bigger than our small, confined worlds.Oz is meant to represent the colorful palette of our imagination but for Dorothy it is also a place where she does some growing up. The three friends that she meets along the way, The Scarecrow, The Tin Man and The Lion are emblematic of the lessons of bravery, love and devotion and the ability to think for ourselves. The Wicked Witch of the West certainly represents the real dangers along the way. For Dorothy there is a matronly figure, Glinda the Good Witch who intends for Dorothy to discover for herself how to solve her problems, she knows that Dorothy must grow up along the way. In a way, she seems to represent the parent that Dorothy doesn't have back in Kansas. Her aunt and uncle love her but this was a movie made during the depression and we imagine the climate that they live in, where work means keeping the farm. No work = no farm = no home.For 1939, Dorothy was the perfect character for young girls. She echoes many of the small town country girls who, in the midst of the depression, packed their suitcases and ran to Hollywood seeking fame and fortune in the movies. For them this film is a cautionary tale that they'd be better off if they just stayed home. Judy Garland was perfect in the role, 17 at the time, but with wide-eyes and a beautiful, open face she carries that sense of wonderment of a child. Like most of us as children, her only true companion is a dog named Toto and the most frightening moment in the film is when she is nearly robbed of her best friend. When she sings 'Over the Rainbow' we know that it's to escape an unhappy childhood (she has apparently lost her parents) and for Garland we identify. She began in show business as a kiddie act with her sisters and began her long movie career when she was only 13. She was already a familiar face from 'Love Finds Andy Hardy' and by the time of 'Oz' she was already under contract to MGM. That she was familiar to audiences helped her in the role. That familiarity works well with her ability to project the vulnerability and melancholy that the character has to have. We have to believe that she will become frightened and that her life will be in danger because if she doesn't that we sense that the character can work her way out of the situation herself and our interest wanes.If movies are a time capsule than 'The Wizard of Oz' wonderfully captures a brief moment of happiness in Garland's life. We know of her problems with studio execs that put her through an exhausting schedule and used drugs to get her going in the morning then put her to sleep at night. We know the legends of her mental and physical problems that dogged her most of her life but 'The Wizard of Oz' sees her at a moment in her life when it all seemed perfect, just as her star was rising and before her problems really began. There's poignancy in that, and that's why I think that the casting of Shirley Temple in the role would have been a mistake. By 1939, Temple was the biggest star in the world her presence in the film would have been too much, she would have stood out and we would only seen Shirley Temple, not Dorothy Gale.Garland's presence allows the story a certain credibility. I have tried to imagine that famous dance down the Yellow Brick Road with a 4 foot child and it just doesn't fit.If Garland gives the film its center than I think the production design, awe-inspiring in 1939, is the perfect backdrop. In these early musicals filmed on a soundstage it isn't hard to spot where the soundstage ends. Some have seen that as a flaw but I think it adds to the dreamlike quality of the film. The matte paintings behind the sets add to the storybook quality. The fact that we're in a dream makes it okay that the special effects look a little hasty. That was the genius of the screenplay, that and to establish the Oz characters as characters that Dorothy meets in Kansas. In our dreams we often see people and events that have recently occurred in our lives, but this is the first time I've ever seen it expressed in a movie. In particular is the notion that Professor Marvel keeps showing up as various characters in the dream.What generosity the filmmakers had. What ingenuity to create this entire world that is colorful and beautiful and scary. What depth of character they created. What messages they send. This is a movie constructed with loving care. We're told that those who worked on the film just thought of this as just another movie, but when I watch the film I find that hard to believe. Certainly from the screenwriters. I wonder if they saw how brilliantly they were tapping our frustrations and our excitement, our dreams, our need and our sense of wonderment. I wonder if they knew the impact of what they were working on, that the lovely sentiments that they created would still resonate 60 years later. I wonder if they knew that their heart's desires weren't that far from our own.
  Not as cutting edge as the original. But there are some nice visuals.The movie is much better than the ratings given here. It is a decent adaption and still has some of the philosophical concerns from the original.
  I have no idea why the critics were not kind to this film. A brilliant film in just about every category. Just hoping they make more...
  absolute masterpiece... cinematography,music, actors...
  With incredible action scenes that will undoubtedly stand the test of time, intriguing characters, and a handful of fantastic performances, Mad Max: Fury Road is an amazing visual experience and a very well made film.
  One of the best action movies of the decade. Seldom do I give a 5 star rating since even good movies have flaws. But this one has so little of them, and such does not even matter.Outstanding sound effects and use of colours. Visually popping are those explosions and even the sky and sand looks amazing, while the score is moving and spot on. Combine the two and we get the famous Australian dystopian world of Mad Max, so mesmerizing, enchanting.Everything is a marvel to behold. George's direction is exceptional. He creates new cinematic techniques of conveying action sequence without much reliance of cliche shots. The end product is very fast-paced, effectively creating the sense chaos that comes with good action sequences. Ambitious is one word to sum this up.As the background characters yell weird monologues, while others swing to and fro over the War Rig commencing more and more crazy, feral action, the films keeps on delivering the thrills under such a unique ambience, and I can't help but be captivated by every one of its key moments. Marvel, X men, DC dominate the box office nowadays, but those action scenes are just for fun. Airport scene from CA: Civil War for instance, the one scene everyone extols, is admittedly for fan indulgence and fun. Fury Road is alone, but it is much more. It is of higher quality, and instead of delivering sheer fun it thrills. Hope that there are people like George who realizes how important these films are and continue to make more of them in the near future.
  A masterclass of film making. This is an action film with the right blend of carefully handled character development. You are left to draw on your knowledge of Mad Max and his world to figure out how things stand. It doesn't lack for story at all - it simply doesn't spoonfeed you. I watched this a second time with my friend at the biggest IMAX in Europe, and I can safely say that it changed my outlook on action movies.So interesting to see the cyclical inspiration of Max Max > Borderlands > Mad Max too!
  funnier than i thought it would be
  A beautifully deep, authentic movie. Gorgeous film, expertly acted. Provoking. Mahershala Ali is a superb actor -- and this is some of his most honest work. Which is saying something.
  One of the biggest achievements in cinematic history, The Wizard of Oz is a bright, bold, and utterly fantastic film that showcases memorable songs, an incredible acting performance by Judy Garland and old fashioned special effects that have aged unbelievable gracefully. The film is one of the few pre-millenia films that could actually pass as a modern film because of its attention to detail and creative ideas.
  I won't talk about the visuals of the movie. Although dazzling and much written about, no visuals could possibly eclipse the powerful ideas it has to offer. And this is exactly the part that many critics seem to neglect for some bizarre reason.On the one hand we have the world of men: infused with phony ideology, drunk on fake glory, and built for the sole purpose of feeding into power of a single man at the top. The rusty hierarchy is squeezing out just enough juice to keep the masses eke out an existence, but always wanting for more. The only exception is Mad Max, who, although an outsider, has also given up on hope.On the other, we have Furiosa in the midst of a rebellious act, fleeing this pathetic existence with the few drops of purity it birthed, toward a Green Place. Through methodical hard work, she came to possess just enough trust and power to escape - for redemption, she said, but we learn soon after that she needed hope more than anything and anyone.The attention to detail is astounding. In the action movie, which would normally just settle for a lot of CGI and loud sounds (and which MMFR has plenty of), the details are so abundant that they seem almost gratuitous: the school yard lingo you'd expect from a gang that maybe got stranded and grew up on an island and knows no one but each other; the unusual arsenal of tricks and weaponry suited for road wars; the war drums and flame-throwing electrical guitars that fulfill the role of military marches, yet much more shrill and insane; the skeletal arm drawing on the side of the rig. These couldn't have possibly be fashioned by anyone other than someone absolutely obsessed with that violent and grotesque world, someone who lived there for decades, and who survived to tell the tale. That's why this world, like a powerful magnet, clicks into place so naturally, into a hole that was apparently there - no lengthy explanations are needed, because the darkness it exposes lives in all of us.At one point, I felt the anger so boundless I couldn't contain myself; it just exited in a shriek and left me shaken to my core for the remainder of their journey. I hesitate to call this an 'episode' of a 'film' for fear that it would diminish what it stirred. It is belief in justice, in freedom, in peace that is defiled and trampled upon if we only give in to the darker demons of our nature - if what rules instead are greed, bigotry, and violence.What really got imprinted into my brain were the Many Mothers. The old women with dry chuckles and winks and smiles were the most reassuring, the most human sight of the entire spectacle. We need these women in our lives: those who don't listen to the war cries and war horns, but believe in their own righteousness and purity. Given the chance, they will create and grow and nurture, but they will fight with all their strength to preserve what's right when the have to. If only men were not so caught up on their greed, lust, and war games, we might have had a better, kinder world. If we trust our better nature, we just might, eventually.
  The critics are wrong about this one. If you don't see this one you're missing out.
  I've read the reviews of this movie, and I have to say that I disagree with it's critics. I loved it! It's what a spring/summer movie should be. It doesn't take itself too seriously and loads it's of fun. Will it win any Oscars, def not, but it's enjoyable and a cool take on an old story.
  pretty much as expected...watchable b movie
  Phenomenal. Truly beautiful. It's Art!
  The Wizard of Oz is showing at AMC Altamonte all day is tomorrow for $16.00 (or 11:40 at $10.50). Then Fri, Sat & Sun. it will only show at 11:40 $10.50. Then a Mon showing at noonish. The countdown is on!
  Mindless fun. Had quite a few laughs. The movie was worth the admission price.
  A predictable story filled with cliche moments that abrupt ends. The lackluster story forgot to explain many things in the story. The CGI was either unrealistically done or is really ugly-looking. In the end, Monster Trucks was a bad movie.
  To be honest, I wasn't interested in seeing this movie. However when I was looking for something to see on an impromptu boys night with my 13yo, this was the best option. Although after going I will say that this is one of the most fun times I've had at a movie in awhile. I will agree with allot of the critics in that this is a familiar story that has been interpreted better, and often. However that is not what Guy Ritchie is going for, this is just meant to be a fun Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels set in Arthurian times. The movie moves at a pace that makes the running time very deceptive. The visuals are a melding of Frazetta, Tolkien, and Excalibur. The acting is sufficient, Jude Law is a little over the top, but in a good way, and Hunnam brings a little bit of Jax in his Arthur, but it fits the character. Unfortunately, I believe that the legend that created the following and funding for this film, may also be it's downfall. In this day and age I don't believe that very many are asking for or wanted another King Arthur story, that could have easily been set in an original fantasy world. Which is unfortunate, because this is a fun film that returns Guy Ritchie to his root style, and should be seen by all who can suspend disbelief, and just enjoy a fun action movie.
  Best movie of 2015 definitely. George Miller creation keeps us awake till the end. Breathtaking action and road rage that Miller keeps from us for so many years finally gives us back in mad franchise sequel. Every planed scene and desert wasteland is escape to mad adventure that you can't get out until the end of the movie. Vehicles and chase is portrayed with power in them and badass destruction. Once more Hardy shows us that he is capable of doing seriously fantastic movies and giving us special performance. Charlize as Furiousa is something special as she takes us to journey of good and mad. As Tolkien wrote Lord of the Rings universe, George Miller gave us Mad Max universe. 100/100
  The ultimate chick-flick with two women fighting over a pair of shoes, but still visually entertaining with sing-along fun. Plus, if you listen to "Dark Side of the Moon" on in the background, it's even better.
  Monster Trucks is a film designed to be enjoyable for children and to be a boring ride for everyone else. If you have nothing else to do than watching your child dying to see this movie, go ahead and do it, but please bring equipment. This film is literally a borefest.
  There is a danger to Post Apocolyptic movies. The future is SO bleak, there is nothing to fight for, and therefore no tension. After about an hour and I gave up hope and fell asleep. Never has so much action made me sleep so soundly.
  One of those movies that everyone loves but nobody remembers.
  This movie was not what I expected it is very hard to look at because it's very predictable and filmmakers should not be seen during scenes not necessarily an edge of your seat film
  Mad Max is a spectacle. Perhaps the most beautiful action movie I've ever seen due to its fluid action sequences, intense color juxtaposition, and grand-scale set pieces. Its story is basic to the point of brilliance; the only thing you need to be concerned about is the gorgeous mayhem happening on screen.
  When looking at a trailer for "Monster Trucks," you can easily say that it looks like any other poorly made January cash-grab. However, "Monster Trucks" will suprise audiences by being more than that. Although the over-the-top performances and the poor production value are certaintly not ideal, kids should have a fun time with "Monster Trucks." One thing that really bothered me about the film was the first act. It wasn't slow, but the characters were so dumb that it was hard to feel for them in their situations. The camera work was also pretty questionable, but everything (for the most part) is just mediocre enough that the target audience won't seem to care.
  Top action movie of last 20 years!
  It's strangely crafted with similar drama as one would find in a college feminist's story about the struggle of being a woman. That's not to dismiss that there is a real struggle that comes with being a woman, and likewise with being Black and gay, but the problem is that it relies too heavily on the sympathy of the audience to create their own engagement with the film solely on the fact that the main character has such struggles. A film can't simply have that most bare skeleton of a plot and be good. There has to be good characters, good acting, and nuance, and with all that together creates the engagement/intrigue. Sadly this film has none of that and opts to stay relatively flat and empty throughout, minus the bare minimum conflict that there actually was (which the film chooses not to follow even though it was the most interesting part). All in all, pretty dull.
  Despite how dumb this movie looks, I've seen dumber movies.
  Conceived by MGM as an answer to Walt Disney's Snow White, this sweet and colorful fable full of music and adventure will always be a pleasure to children everywhere due to its relatable characters and universal message, though it may prove a bit slow for adults nowadays.
  Amazing movie that covers so many subjects. Every actor that played the lead role was very good. The movie as a whole presented as very vulnerable
  Fun movie and fast. other than that it's nothing.,
  Much, much funnier than the very funny original. It does have a low budget feel, which is fine. Watch for Peter Gallagher reprising his character from While You Were Sleeping. Kathryn Hahn is a force of nature in this.
  Much like the main character, Ghost in the Shell is missing a heart. And the lack of emotion almost makes this feel like a science fiction demo reel instead of a major motion picture. It's got some impressive visual effects, but that's about it. It's not that surprising that this movie didn't succeed at the box office.
  It won't let me watch full movie
  Looks great, acting and casting was great, but the story line is dumbed down and this ruins the movie.
  The movie was just like the anime, only with a different name for the Major, and there was a backstory on Batou's eyes.
  A handful of funny moments, but mostly just over the top crude and extremely depressing. Not funny, hopefully they learn from this and the third one will resemble the first and be hilarious. Two thumbs down on Bad Moms 2
  You can see the template for Star Wars and a hundred other movies in this justly-lauded classic, but even after a million viewings it's the heart and sentiment that catch you, especially knowing that it was released at the beginning of the 2nd World War, when home and family were so important, and courage, heart and thought pre-eminent. A marvellous journey every time.
  Guy Richie is becoming one of my favorite directors. Nice spin on a classic tale, This movie moves fast for the casual film buff, but in reality this movie will go down as a Cult classic... Richie keep the story moving fast, without getting to hung up on being a dull orgin movie, as we have seen multiple times with Spider-Man or the Batman tales. Great acting and cast, Jude Law is always a solid actor, and Charlie Hunnam delivers a great young soon to be king. I am very disappointed in the reviews and the rotten 29%, but like I said, this movie will gather steam and become a cult classic...
  Stunning movie with amazing visuals and brilliant non-stop car action.
  It's not meant to be an in-depth story, we all know King Arthur, Merlin, Camelot, but what we never see is some pretty sick action scenes and just a gritty telling of Arthur and his rise. This short version is fun, action packed and just an overall good fantasy movie. If you watch it thinking about the story of Arthur and the knights of the round, you might not like it, so just sit down open your mind and watch a cool movie about swords and magic.
  i dont care what people think :) i like the movie very much seen it 2 times already would like to go again :)
  Mad Max Fury Road is a modern day action masterpiece. I cannot praise Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron and the rest of the cast for creating such an amazing film. And of course the incredible George Miller. Mad Max Fury Road is an absolute Marvel in presentation, characters and most importantly action. I think it's best for me to leave it there because as you can tell Mad Max Fury Road is an absolutely incredible film which will go down in the books for a very long time. 5/5
  What a waste of great talent!
  I have seen 1500 plus movies in my life, this is the worst one I have ever seen in my 31 years on earth. I think the reviews must be fake. Not to mention all the twisted metal ripoffs.
  Great Movie! Kids really enjoyed it! Don't pay attention to the nay-saying critics. It's a fun fictional movie!
  If you're looking for a painfully boring experience with not one drop of joy or inspiration about anything memorable to take away - this one's for you. I would daresay 5 or 10 years after it won the Oscar for best picture, not many will want to see it (or remember it). To add salt into the wound, there was one last thing that really wanted to make me slap the director: Speaking as a food industry pro, I guess it was only a fitting piece of ridiculousness was when the cook in the diner was also (wait for it).... the waiter! And the cashier! I have my theories on how & why this movie got made (and won any awards at all).
  For me it was the best movie of 2017. Great scenes fights, nice speed in the storytelling, good characters and a new way to tell the king Arthur history.
  The Bad Moms crew does it again!! It's hilarious and so fantastic because it's so believable and relatable. They truest understand the plight of motherhood and do an excellent job of portraying the challenges and the beauty that leads up to one day. Love love love!
  Absolutely insane reviews. It's a popcorn flick with little storyline that's been told much better in other wasteland future flicks including some of the oldest Anime in existence like Fist of the North Star. You have to lower your expectations to such abysmal levels and forgive it more than several dozen times for it's inconsistancies and lack of realistic human death in such a dystopian future. What makes it all the worse, is the over praise of it. It's a fine waste of 2 hours, but don't expect humor, realism, depth, or even good action. B-movie with a high budget and no depth - if that's as low as your expectations are then you may enjoy it. I know how mine have dwindled to nothing out of hollywood and I still think this was just barely above shutting off.
  More of the same, yet not as good as its predecessor. It's got some cringeworthy moments, but there's some funny bits to be had. All mashed up with the typical mushy sentiment by the end. Pretty much what you'd expect from a movie like this.
  I love this movie and judy garland
  A fun original movie that all audiences will enjoy and has a few subtle political and environmental messages up its sleeve as we head into a weird time.
  An ordinary story of a poor black boy growing up and fallen into crime. no plot, no great scenes or moral... NOT THE MOVIE OF THE YEAR...
  Timeless and new every time you see it. Let the nostalgia take over.
  Raw, powerful and emotional. The acting really made the audience feel the desperation and hopelessness of growing up in that environment.
  Pretty bad. More like stageplay than a movie. Didn't make it more than 30 minutes.
  The Wizard of Oz is no more than a bland and mediocre production.
  Max Max Fury Road was a masterpiece. I give it 4/5 stars because it wasn't really my type of movie.
  Best movie I've seen in a long time
  The story was enjoyable if you like the arty slow moving type of movie. I would not define as remarkable. What is quite sad is that he lives to see his mum go through the drug addiction and then chooses that parth of drug selling for himself. So he is a quiet intraverted character with no spine really.
  Enjoyable only on a shallow level, this adaptation really doesn't prove it's need to exist (the irony) while wasting what was a compelling performance from Scar Jo. This is a typical Rupert Sanders workmanship-like visual but shallow product. Meh...
  The subjects have spoken and the nobility doesn't like it.
  Great Movie Watching Right Now in Cartoon Network 1939 One The Best xD
  Great action/fantasy movie. Guy Ritchie gives this movie a really unique feel: it's almost like a gang/mafia film in a fantasy setting. The only criticism I have is that (mild SPOILER) the smoke demon turns out to be something sort of boring, and that the final fight has too much obvious CGI.
  A timeless classic that never gets old for me no matter how many times I see or what age I am....fave!
  Nostalgic in every sense, The Wizard of Oz is a wonderful example of classic Hollywood. It may not be perfect, but it never gets old and always delights.
  Amazing film my favourite movie I love it
  THE BEST ACTION MOVIE IN DECADES!!!! A must watch for all cine fans.
  Not Woody Allens best!
  Clearly Gay Men haven't been reviewing this movie...this is sooo much better than the reviews would suggest!
  I think it was pretty good to talk about what to do to build confidence, but missed some information, but nonetheless a classic.
  Moments of the movie left, wondering why they needed a sequel, but then the cast showed you exactly why you needed to see these Current day moms!
  I love this movie! The storyline is amazing, but it depends on the type of genres you like, so if you like post-apocalyptic genres, survival, and action, this movie is for you!
  Either I haven't seen anything like it, or this piece its truly one of a kind. Amazing colors and acting. Solid way to tell a story. A few of the shots do feel a little bit staged but are executed in a beautiful way that you might not care. If you don't like analyzing anything just skip this movie.
  A classic and the greatest musical of all time!
  the plight of a gay boy becoming a man in one of the roughest places in Miami made for a phenomenal movie. The direction they decided to take the movie was the perfect artistic choice; one that I thought they weren't going to take, but I was pleasantly surprised with part 3 goin the direction it did.
  I'm not sure why this movie provoked so much ire... I thought it was good and very entertaining. Also, Charlie Hunnam is very watchable.
  best movie of the year so far
  Great movie for kids. Loved the concept and music!
  Over-rated by Rotten tomatoes. Nothing was special about this and you give it 9.4/10 no!!!, my score 7/10
  Just the BEST MOVIE EVER. Best story, best actors, best everything.
  This movie was clearly made for long-time fans of the Japanese manga and anime series. As I happen to be one such long-time fan, I enjoyed the film immensely. However, I did notice that much of the storytelling relies on viewers having at least some prior knowledge of the characters. Those watching this movie as an introduction to the miniverse of GitS are likely to walk away feeling mildly to moderately confused or disappointed. Yes, it has some amazing special effects, but almost everything pays homage to some level or another to the original material. I also feel that SJ captures the soul of her character, and despite the fact that she was shoehorned into a role ideally meant for someone of Asian descent, I feel she did what was intended, which was honor the original character as a person, rather than the shell of one's appearance or origin.
  One of the best movies ever made.
  Great storytelling, execution but I'm not sure it deserves the Oscar
  Having never seen and of the other Mad Max films, I went into this blind on a random night with a buddy of mine. Within the first few minutes of them film I was absolutely blown away. Beautiful cinematography awed me and captivating characters made me wanting more. I only hope more comes of this new entry in the franchise.
  A simply outstanding (as well as outstandingly simple) post-apocalyptic, dystopian, punk, Western, car chase action film. Director George Miller said that he aspired to Hitchcock's ideal of a film that a person in Japan could watch, enjoy, and understand without reading any subtitles. And Miller has damn well succeeded. If I have one complaint, it's that not enough time was spent on the slave women: their sleeping arrangements, their bathing rituals, their unblemished bodies. What is sex like in the world of Mad Max? Specifically, group sex? I guess we'll never know. Le sigh.Srsly, though: bravo, George Miller. Take a bow.
  Adiei por um ano esse filme pensando que seria mais um drama qualquer sobre um jovem negro em um bairro pobre americano, e ainda bem que eu não poderia estar mais enganado. Fui agraciado com um dos filmes mais tocantes e sensíveis, de uma beleza única e que foge de todos os padrões de produções da mesma temática.O primeiro aspecto que não poderia deixar de comentar são as atuações, e que escolha de casting perfeita, todos os atores entregam performances dignas de Oscar, não a toa que Naomie Harris e Mahershala Ali foram indicados e um deles até levou a estatueta pra casa. Naomie nos entrega um atuação tão real em uma personagem detestável, que percebemos o estudo e a entrega dela à sua atuação, retratando fielmente uma mulher perdida que não sabe como ajudar e reagir as escolhas do filho os mesmo tempo que luta contra seu vicio as drogas. Ali por outro lado, mesmo que na pele de um homem que era pra ser deplorável nos mostra um lado paternal e carinhoso que pode estar presente em qualquer um e somente é necessário uma oportunidade para demonstrar tais sentimentos guardados.Mas os três atores que foram escolhidos para interpretar Chiron durante os três atos do filme dão um show a parte, criando um senso de coesão entre suas atuações realmente passando a sensação que as consequências das ações e decisões enquanto criança refletem em sua fase adulta, a dor e desamparo no olhar e até mesmo sua postura são diferentes em cada parte do filme e ao mesmo tempo são uma só, completando umas as outras.Além das atuações impecáveis, o longa ainda conta com uma direção incrível com cenários e cores deslumbrantes, com um ótimo trabalho de iluminação e pós-produção fazendo cada ato do filme ser completamente diferente do anterior com cada vez mais cores saturadas e azuladas e que dizem muito sobre a situação emocional do protagonista e do seu ambiente. A montagem do filme é milimetricamente calculada, com todas as cenas passando alguma mensagem, nada é em vão nesse filme.O único defeito para mim foi simplesmente o fato de faltar mais, eu queria mais do filme, algumas situações e explicações para alguns acontecimentos teriam me dado uma experiencia mais gratificante mesmo eu entendendo o que o filme queria dizer e onde ele queria chegar. Além de uma ou duas cenas que julguei desnecessárias ou sem algum significado real para a trama.O filme é brilhante e não deve ser perdido por nada, poucas vezes vi algo tão visceral e belo na tela, Moonlight é um exercício para reflexão e para quebras de expectativas e paradigmas que consideramos como certos.
  Do not believe the criticsWatch this movie - it is AMAZINgIt will blow you awayIt will give you strength It delivers on every level
  I love the legend of Arthur and I thought this was a fun retelling of the story. I know a lot of critics bashed it, but I was overly entertained during the whole film. It was definitely setting up the universe of King Arthur. I really wish they had made more money so they could've went with their plans on doing a trilogy. Three 2.5 hr movies would wrap the complete series nicely.
  George Miller proves that age is not a factor, as he returns to the franchise he created, with the best installment yet. Charlize Theron takes us (and Tom Hardy) on a non-stop action thrill-ride that leaves viewers begging for another installment. While the plot is virtually non-existent, Fury Road more than makes up for it with strong characters and an amazing visuals, If you haven't seen Fury Road, you're missing out on the best movie of 2015!
  Gripping, compelling and a visual spectacle 2017s " Ghost In The Shell" is going to live on as this generations "Blade Runner"
  Moonlight is the story of young black child's struggle to find himself in a hard and unaccepting world. This film took me by surprise, it is a brilliantly subtle, realistic and heartfelt depiction of a young man's struggle with his own sexuality and how the world around him effects his identity. The script and the acting is so realistic that it often feels like you've stepped into someone's else's shoes and are watching a real life happening in front of your eyes rather than a film. The film is broken into 3 chapters, Little, Chiron and Black and the 3 actors who portray Chiron, Alex R. Hibbert, Ashton Sanders, Trevante Rhodes are all fantastic, portraying an inner struggle that's just bubbling underneath the surface. Naomie Harris is also excellent as Paula, Chiron's drug addicted mother, showing a great progression in her character as her addiction gets worse.. The film is also beautifully shot and paced with an excellent soundtrack that elevates the story and gives the whole film a quiet grace. Although the narrative itself isn't the most original, it is a beautiful film that tells it's story in very emotional and effective way.
  While a strong sense of discontinuity is there from the beginning, the plot for MM:FR makes itself clear over the course of the film. Unfortunately, there is no real beginning for the characters, the place, the time. It just IS, and we are made to accept it. The end of civilization must be taken at face value in this iteration of the Mad Max franchise, with no real connection to the first Mad Max or even Road Warrior. This film is a close cousin to "Beyond Thunderdome" in its autocratic ruler of the McGuffin. In "Thunderdome", it was Bartertown. In Fury Road, it is the clean water. The road sequences are thrilling and ear-shattering. The action is incredible, and the fight scenes are tough, if not impossible, to beat.I just wish there had been more connection to the previous Max films without a need to have SEEN them all to understand what the heck is going on.
  Winslet great acting; but I leave it a 1.
  I don't understand why most critic reviews were so bad. I am a 50 year old woman who doesn't think many movies are good enough to see in a theater. But trailers for this movie got me so excited that I bought tickets for me and my son a week ahead of time and I paid a lot extra for Dbox and 3D. We loved every minute of the movie, and I can't wait to see it again at home so I can rewind parts that go by too quickly or were especially entertaining. I really hope it makes enough money for sequels to be made!
  Wish I saw King Arthur on the big screen. As for the critics, they don't know what entertains them anymore. For me though, this movie had it all. The cast was killer. Loved Charlie Hunham, Eric Bana, Jude Law, and David Beckham's short bit. The costumes were cool. The sets and effects I found impressive. The film's pace and cockney dialog was classic Ritchie. The story was also pretty epic. A must buy/add to my collection!

  As a Ghost in Shell anime fan this movie truly upset me. I don't care about the "White Washing" but the characters were not portrayed at all like their anime counterparts... Each one of the Section 9 members including the boss man were not played well and it ruined the whole thing for me even while putting myself in the shoes of a person who has never seen the anime. Very Disappointed.
  Seriously my favorite movie of all time.
  One of the greatest showings of visual and audible elegance. This level of vibrance was almost unheard of in 1939, and yet The Wizard Of Oz was able to perfect it. A feat that movies in 2018 can not repeat. Perhaps the greatest movie of all time. 9.8/10
  My nephews loved this movie! I thought it was incredibly cute!
  The film is a visual roller coaster, thanks to the extreme creative genius of the technical crew in crafting a stimulating feast for the eyes that the characters inhabit throughout this post-apocalyptic story. However, it is the story that is the personal drawback for me in the movie, with my failure to become invested enough in the characters or, at times it seemed, the thinly-stretched story across the two-hour runtime. Nevertheless, George Miller brings a refreshing invigoration to his directing that is extremely admirable and impressive.
  A good Christmas film
  I'm a fan of Guy's directing ... music and action sequences reminiscent of Sherlock Holmes ... wish he'd design a virtual reality video game.
  This movie is INCREDIBLE!! One of my favorite action movies period, up there with Die Hard and the first two Terminator movies. It is absolutely insane, loaded with amazing action sequences, and surprisingly a well developed between the main characters. This is a must-see and the best film of 2015, I love it more than Inside Out, Spotlight, and Star Wars: The Force Awakens, I am dead serious.
  Excellent! . Similar to the anime. But scarlet is no major. Motoko's character is calmer and cooler.
  well me and mom love this movie.
  I live, I die. I LIVE AGAIN!
  Awesome! I have no idea why it got bad reviews other than it was a fantasy done in a modern genre and people don't like change. Totally fun, visually epic, and very modern. Highly recommend!!
  Moonlight is a movie directed by Barry Jenkins, and is about a person named Chiron who struggles to realize who he really is, told within 3 chapters of his life starting with him as a young kid, then, to him being a teenager, and then, with him being an adult. I have got to say that this movie was brilliant! Every single part in this film is just perfect! The acting, the writing, the cinematography (which by the way is OUTSTANDING in the film), and the directing by Barry Jenkins is one of a kind. The cast in this film was BEYOND brilliant! The score to this film is riveting! I cannot wait to see what Director Berry Jenkins will make next! Afterwards, Moonlight is a masterpiece by Barry Jenkins, and is a great movie with extremely powerful performances.
  I watch the film and it was awesome and cool. I like the movie it has good and well done acting to the actors and you know what I love it and it's a well done sci-fi film. Even though it can't top LOGAN this year but I like ghost in the shell and it's awesome.
  I like to watch this movie
  Not bad but not good either.
  It's reward season and I wanted to see Moonlight, Lion, 20th Century Woman or Fences but Kids so Monster Trucks! When I was explaining it to someone Mike reminded me "they aren't aliens!" Sorry Mike.
  Lengedary Story told bya modern story teller mixed with CGI from LOTR and 300.ð???
  There's no place like home.
  The movie is a very entertaining thriller with good actors and exciting action sequences. While die hard fans of the film and comic may find some issues with consistency in the plot and world created by the director. It is indisputable that the film lives on its own. As long time reader of the comic I did find this discrepancies a bit sad, but not enough to prevent me to enjoy this visually stunning adaptation. A exciting experience that not quite match the original but yet rewards the viewer. I will definitely recommend it to anyone who seeks a fresh approach to sci-fi.
  A strong, coming-of-age narrative, bringing to the forefront the undiscussed subject of a gay black boy's sexuality.
  A sensory delight! Allowing myself to immerse into this world and contemplate the coming reality of brain transplant was a real treat. This is a humble film, keeping the sound and visual stimulants as consistent as its realistic combat scenes(minimal bullets fired). Thank you to everyone who worked on this film. Don't worry about "source material" for pop movies like this, for most, this is their first exposure to GITS, as is often the case.
  Not really my scene but you can't fault the production values. Very loud but thrilling at times.
  Surprisingly good. Only problem is I feel bad for the married guy. The old Santa got more action than he did from his wife. I'm a guy and both my wife and I found this movie better than the first.
  After a lifetime of unconditionally loving this movie, I recently watched it again waiting for the exact moment in the film that makes it a masterpiece, and I found none. No single moment outshines the next; in this regard, it is smooth as silk. This movie cannot be plucked at and pulled apart, broken down into bite-sized bits to convenience today's "put it in a nutshell" mentality. In fact, I was a little bit disappointed at not quite knowing why it is that I love this movie so much. It comes from something that can't be sought after, bottled up or stored in a designated place. It's the magic. This movie boasts no specific frame more magical than the one before it; each one glistens with the magic of a witch's wand, or a ruby slipper, or an emerald city. Naturally I must commend Judy Garland for knowing that and not hesitating to be a child who still believes in such wizardry. This ageless film captivates children of all ages, and for those, like myself, who have forgotten the magic within them, it serves not as a grim reminder of what they left in childhood, but a friendly offer to bring some of the magic back, if not for just an hour-and-a-half, a prospect that brings a tear to my eye and reminds me that the magic is still there as long as beautiful things like "The Wizard of Oz" still exist in this crazy world.
  Awesome! Loved the action! Loved the car chases! Camera work made me a little dizzy but who cares really! I recommend this to action movie fans!
  Whats makes this movie special is that it is one of those rare movies which is not shot with Green Background, but on real locationWorth a watch !
  No es demasiado buena, no tiene mucha logica, pero se deja ver y entretiene. A mi hijo le ha gustado bastante
  Probably the best film I've seen this year
  Why am I not interested. Two words, rude humor. This is gonna obviously be loaded with toilet jokes. And finally, it just looks boring.
  Dragged in a little bit but this is a story of a situation I haven't even considered before let alone watched.
  My kids love this movie!
  Loved this movie!! All political correctness aside, this tribute to the legend of King Arthur is exciting and sassy! I wish I had seen it in theaters ??Really cool movie, cool soundtrack??
  Great visuals, and you can really get absorbed into the post-apocalyptic world. But, the story is very simplistic and undesirable.
  Awesome action story with fantastic music. Loved it!
  After all the controversy this film created casting Scarlett Johansson, I thought it might at least have a story worth being bugged about. Ghost In The Shell lacks a sensible plot so anything that comes afterwards is worthless really. Casting anybody in the leading role of Major would've lead up to the same outcome: the film is nothing more than overbearing CGI and meaningless action sequences. I wasn't familiar with anime but it sure felt like this nonsense seemed to go on forever and I hated every minute of it.
  The movie, although lacked a sense in legitimacy, was cleverly done in my opinion. King Arthur was action packed and full of great cinematic shots throughout. Definitely one of Guy Richie's better works.
  Timeless... I don't know anybody who doesn't have this film as even a small part of their childhood, and even if there is somebody in the world who doesn't, they will still find something to like in this film. 5/5
  Ghost in the Shell wasn't everything I wanted it to be. Let's start with positives: the cinematography was spectacular, meaning that the futuristic world of Ghost In The Shell was very absorbing. Ghost In The Shell boasts a great story, though it was shown rather than told to the audience. Essential context scenes are marginalised in favour of extravagant SFX. Scarlett Johansson was compelling as Major - a character that had depth. Acting was consistently sound; some characters were underdeveloped. Ghost In The Shell's poor balancing of storytelling with cool visual effects and cinematography let the film down for me.
  the great and wonderful oz and he is
  A timeless masterpiece. Just pure magic.
  As an avid Guy Ritchie fan this movie is typical to his style. It's enjoyable as a stand alone action movie, and is best held separate from the mythos of King Arthur. The dry wit and wry humor mask the drudgery of the world building the movie undertakes. I definitely plan on seeing it several more times while it's in theater.
  there is no place like home..The Wizard Of OzIt is one of those cult classic features that happen to have everything in the right place; from characters to performance and from script to execution. The adaptation is short and smart that covers up every essential information and emotion from the novel and helps connect easily with the audience. Victor Flemming has done a decent work on executing the tale and it works for the major part of it because of his affection and passion towards conveying the right message. The performance is not outstanding but definitely admirable, especially when on creating comic sequences. The Wizard Of Oz not only works as a whole project, but score majestically on technical aspects too like costume design, production design, background score, choreography and songs that helps celebrate it on such large scale.
  Critics are crap. If ur looking for historical... wrong movie. But if u dig stylistic action combined with awesome tunes & beautiful FX, this is your movie! Felt a bit short but a great, great watch!
  How could someone not like this classic?
  This movie received a 27% (for whatever reason), but has been one of the better movies I have seen this year. Guy Richie did a great job directing, as well as the actors did in their roles. If you want to see a great movie, and can dismiss the idiocy of the "Tomatometer" you will enjoy a great flick.
  Boring formulaic garbage. I want my money back.
  Great visuals but I just wasn't interested in any of the story
  What can I say about "The Wizard of Oz" that hasn't been said already, it's a down right classic, simple as that.
  OPERATIC BEAUTY AND SADNESS
  Totally Awesome, a must see for any true Sci-Fi nerd and anyone who has played the game.This film has some amazing eye candy in the form of effects and Scarlett Johansson really does pull the part off and made it her own.Must Watch!!
  Just not good at all
  Terrific movie! Moonlight lives up to all the hype.
  Amazing movie. Those who criticise don't understand the original themes that were so brilliantly represented and surprisingly not over Hollywoodised. Great CGI and wonderful performance of both Scarlett Johansson and Pilou Asbaek. The original Japanese themes remain intact as does the entire philosophical question of what is the mind and the soul.
  The visuals were great, the story was good. I liked it, i dnt see why everyone is butt hurt about a white girl playing a ROBOT!!!!
  A fun-filled adventure with a fun story. However, seems like any other Nickelodeon movie.
  I need King Arthur part 2 please. Awesome movie. Forget the critics, this is a great movie to watch.
  Moonlight is an artistic and fascinating movie that will stick with you. However, I feel alone in thinking Chiron in the final act was unconvincing. I pictured him growing up to be more fabulous. Still, quality original movie overall.
  i have no idea why this does not correspond with the critics. great acting, wonderful moments, visuals, music ... yes, it is a drama and yes, it lacks the humor we´re used to from allen. but that definitely is intentional and it´s an interesting new facet in allen´s late work.
  I heard from a guy that lived in 1939 that says this movie was the best movie of the year. can't wait to see it!
  Awesome, technically sophisticated movie, that actually tries hard, to give credit to the original manga / anime sources. The futuristic world is a joy to look at. If you like to visit futuristic, slightly run-down urban worlds, like we've seen in "Blade Runner" or "The Fifth Element" with "Matrix"-like action pieces, this movie delivers! Unfortunately, there has been a campaign, with the intent to smear the movie's reputation by accusing it of "whitewashing", because the lead role was not given to an actor of Asian descent, but to Scarlett Johansson, who does a remarkable job of basically playing a cyborg. The subtle way she's moving, turning and shifting her weight, to appear more robot-like is great acting. But she's white and that's enough for a small, but very vocal minority, to "hate" on this magnificent piece of Sci-Fi action movie, which is kinda sad.If you take the time to watch the extra footage, you will notice, how much the film makers actually tried to honour the source material, but the "whitewashing"-screamers don't care, they drank the "more diversity" (meaning: less whites!) Kool-Aid and decided, that this film has to be "bad" because of Hollywood's very relatable decision, to cast the movie's leading role with a well known, established actress, that is supposed to get as many people into the cinemas as possible, instead of some Asian no-name, what's the surprise?! That's just, how Hollywood works. And IS the main character really that much different from it's manga original?! Johansson plays a character, called "Major", who (SPOILER!!!) later finds out, that she's actually an Asian(!) girl, named Motoko Kusanagi, that has been recruited without her knowledge and been given a new body / shell. The whole story plays in a world, where everybody can swap and enhance their bodies with all sorts of technical and biomechanical gimmicks. So an Asian character in an artificial white body is enough for many people to condemn and shun this beautiful film?! I'm far from being an expert for the original GITS manga / anime, I've seen the anime years ago and didn't like it much, but I'm not an anime fan at all. But from what I recall, the main character was a girl called "Motoko Kusanagi", who inhibits an artificial body, that looks pretty westernized to my eyes. But it's an artificial body anyway, she could appear as a person of colour or even as a man! So, where's the difference?! I'm sure, this whole "whitewashing" smear campaign has gotten way out of proportion, after having been completely unjustified, in the first place.Another point of critique was, that the movie doesn't concentrate enough on the philosophical themes of GITS and doesn't dive deep enough into it. Again, I'm not an expert for the original, but those themes are in the movie, a lot of it, actually. Major is constantly searching for her humanity and there is some philosophical dialogue throughout the movie, but this is, first and foremost, a fast-paced action movie, not a full blown philosophical excourse in what makes us human. If you like those sort of themes, you might be better off by purchasing the mangas. I personally think, this movie has just the right amount of philosophical themes to think about afterwards, without spoiling the formidable action. I wouldn't want to sit through two hours of heavy philosophical discussion, I love crazy action and shootouts and the film delivers! If you like Sci-Fi and masterfully executed action in a Blade Runner-like urban setting, you should give this film a chance, it is worth it and a great, but very, very underrated piece of Sci-Fi action cinema.
  Wowsa! So well done.
  It humanizes what character development it has, and keeps it simple from the storytelling perspective. But the centerpiece here are the action sequences, beautifully done, and breaking a few action cliches we see in movies today. My tiny problem with the film was the way George Miller transitioned his scenes; they slowed down a film a bit, but does not damage the film as a whole.
  A symphony of exploding mayhem ! Solid acting, storytelling and visually engaging all the way to the end.
  Just see and we'll talk about its flawlessness
  Amazing movie of quiet moments that scream truth. Great acting and a visionary director.
  Great action, loved it!
  An adrenaline rush in a high order of film making
  A really enjoyed it.... it was funny and badass!
  fun feel good movie. plus I loved the creature design.
  Well shot and highly entertaining.
  FINALLY a great modern fantasy done right loved it and will watch it over and over again
  Brilliant movie the editing and pace of the movie made it refreshing to watch and despite the athurian ledgers being evolved, the original concept still stands as the ledgend of athur itself is highly evolved too, so it doesn't seem bad that the plot was evolved from the legend . This movie was well done despite its extra large budget. I recommend as for once it's something new and non idealistic.
  Funny! Just what you need for a girls night! A movie for grown women. People complaining about the language may not have noticed it was rated R before seeing it. I love the three main characters. This movie is more slapstick then the original, but it is silly and fun!
  Horrible movie. Bad acting and no character development.
  I wasn't expecting much from this movie but I have to say as an adult I really enjoyed it. In addition, the other mom and five kids (girls and boys) I went with loved the movie. I would much rather see it again than "Sing" which we thought was a little boring other than the end song sequence. Monster Trucks is just over two hours long but we felt it went by really fast. The action was nonstop and held our attention the whole time. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking to fill an afternoon with the kids.
  After all the negative comments and critical reviews, I thought I would give it a chance for myself. All I can say is that if you like Bladerunner, you will love this movie. I'm not certain that Scarlett Johansson was the best casting for this role but I thought the move as a whole was wildely imaganative and really amazingly directed. I was not famililiar with the original Anime material, so I was not hindered by what I thought the movie should be and just simply, let it be itself. I was a beautiful ride.
  You guys got it wrong...this is a great movie. Just the right balance of mystic and natural laws, innocence and evil, action and dialogue. Charlie Hunnam was perfect as was the sound track. I would have it on a loop if I had a copy.
  A fantastic, beautifully told film with some masterful directing and perfect cinematography.
  Took me a long while to get around to watching it, but now I suddenly get where all sorts of cultural memes come from (Lions! And Tigers! And Bears! Oh my!).Spectacular for the era in which it was made, and it actually aged pretty well too. It's not perfect, having a few things that it never bothers to answer (for instance, what exactly is the Tin Man supposed to be? An automaton? And what about the woman who wants to put Toto down?), and it's obvious that they're trying to stretch the run time sometimes (e.g. all the singing by the Munchkins) but those are minor things and it's actually still enjoyable, and surprisingly not-cheesy, in fact not at all painful in any way really.Moreover, it was actually pretty clever, even if a bit simple. And even if it's not the best thing ever made, the status of a classic is well-earned for all of these reasons.I don't think I can say anything that anyone else hasn't said before, you all know the drill, blah blah classic blah blah watch it if you're a film buff.
  George Miller's, Mad Max Fury Road is a visually thrilling film for the audience to enjoy and view. The storyline is just amazing, to be able to see the main protagonist; Furiosa take us through her journey to the 'green land'. And then she and other main characters such as Max was found to be making a drastic attempt to have control over the citadel. The locations where Mad Max Fury Road is filmed couldn't be any better as the location is best placed for a film with having to get vital needs such as a quiet desert. Mad Max Fury Road is very profitable as it had a hefty budget of 200 million dollars during the production of the film, with their worldwide box gaining over 300 million dollars.
  Looks like the worst movie ever to come out of the vile beast that is Hollywood. Of course I want to see it!
  I walked out. so boring!
  Some great cinematography takes you through the emotional life of a young man.
  Exceptional acting from Scarlett Johannsen. Decent plot that should have been explored more thoroughly. Great supporting cast that I wanted to learn more about. I can understand why this would work better as a series, but it had great action and a uniquely immersive world that made this movie worth watching. A definite recommendation. I wish to see more of this world.
  Great, epic fantasy movie! Final confrontation looks like nothing else ever before, and by now is my fav. duel ever.
  A thrill ride from start to finish - Mad Max: Fury Road thrives on its non-stop, suspense-filled action sequences.
  I don't know what they are talking about...I LOVED THIS MOVIE!
  Everything i could want in a movie. Giant elephants, cool magic, sword fights... Yet somehow despite that, this movie is dull as rocks and an ordeal to get through.
  Unconventional love story with a lot of biographical background. It is a bit episodic but the power of its ending is not diminished.
  A fantasy musical that ruled it all in the late 1930s.
  Cheesy reunion film. Pushes black, male sexuality without adult males kissing. I won't remember this film.
  La primera parte es entretenida y pasable, lleva toda la marca de Ritchie, pero la segunda mitad es aburrida e increíblemente tonta, el papel de Law da vergüenza y la historia es todo un novelón sin sentido.
  good movie my kid 7 loved loved it
  Did you see the trailer? If so you saw all the parts worth watching.
  An other "trying too hard, but failing" movie. It has some good parts, some nice shots, some ok acting but a story, it has none. It is an overly artsy movie, playing too much with colours and forgetting what really counts, having a story or an idea and being able to communicate said story, said idea.
  After seeing this film, comparing Moonlight to Boyhood feels a little bit shallow. While Boyhood uses age as a true set-piece, Moonlight uses age to tell a story about acceptance and belonging. For a movie that is based in Florida, it's hard for people to come into this movie not expecting a story about growing up in harsh environment. While the film does this fairly well, that is most definitely not it's focus. The film can naturally speak to anyone who has ever experienced a feeling that only resides with time and understanding of one's self.
  I enjoyed it.There were a few similarities to The Lord of the Rings, and you could tell it was a Guy Ritchie film but it wasn't bad.
  Damn fine film. Excellent character study.And very much like "We Need to Talk About Kevin" all three leads playing Moonlight's protagonist Chiron, are all note-perfect and compelling.Not at all what you might be expecting. Very little violence. No bloodshed (unless a scratch counts.) No explicit sex (save for a few brief intimate moments, one being a dream sequence.) Just a mesmerizing glide through a young introverted man's life, dealing with a drug-using Mom at home and gay-bashing adolescents being cruel for the easy pickings of it.A few questions left unanswered don't detract from the sheer pleasure of watching this hypnotic drama. Extremely well-crafted and ends on a note of reconciliation and no unnecessary "feel-good" contrivances. A sleeper hit and deservedly so.
  I thought this movie was awesome! You can't take what critics say with a grain of salt; most of them will give a horrible movie 7 to 8 out of 10, while leaving the movies worth seeing in the dark! I suggest anyone to see it, and criticize it yourself.
  I just don't get musicals, I don't know why I keep trying. It's not that this is a bad film it's just I don't find people skipping along singing songs with smug, knowing lyrics interesting. Dorothy's 3 accomplices I found all annoying plus why does Dorothy look like a prostitute dressed up as a little girl? Why is the good witch of the East about 76? It's not for me, sorry. 2 stars just because Judy Garland singing 'Somewhere Over The Rainbow' is spot on breathtaking though.
  Really wierd, but really really good! An absolute joy to watch every second is exhilarating, possibly the best car chases ever. A use of effects that adds to the film instead of distracting from whats happening. Masterpiece, a film i wont easily forget.
  what a great movie def worth watching!!
  It may not be the original story, but which adaptation truly is? Guy Ritchie breathes new life into the legend, adding his own unique flair to it and imagining new things to incorporate, and what else is storytelling for? Charlie Hunnam is sincere in his role and plays a believably street tough Arthur who doesn't understand or want what he is destined for.
  Typical self sexploitation by Scarjo. Her butt is incredibly sexy in a scuba diving costume. Beat Takeshi is used as mere racial prop to appease the audience in the country where the manga was originally written. Includes a little violence and some gunshot action sequences, as well her previous efforts, Lucy and her character in the MCU. Only worth the time if you are an admirer of her body, as yours truly.
  Was really funny. Glad I ignored the reviews and saw it with my girlfriends. It's not for everyone but was definitely funny throughout the whole movie!
  Incredible film. Not seen a film like this in a long, long time.
  Absolutely hilarious! Story line was better in the first movie but this one was still pretty good.
  Two stars is being kind.
  I liked this movie was not what I expected. I would watch it again enjoyed it. Would like to see if they have a sequel ??????
  Loved every minute of it. Hadn't expected to but I did. ^_^ Nostalgia Critic's review inspired me to watch it.
  Good stylized action adventure movie, especially great fight scenes
  Thrilling ride from start to finish! Amazing journey with a good story curve out of one giant chase scene.
  A very interesting style of direction, with the fast-forwarding cinematography. The costumes look pretty cool, and Jude Law does his part to be evil. The film doesn't aim to explain all the deep mythical history of the film. The final battle, while cool, was too cliche. Still a nice movie to watch for it's fantasy rendition of an old story.
  heart breaking and moving
  Popcorn action candy - nothing more, nothing less.
  sparse and brutal, tense, nerve-wracking and harrowing
  Why is the rated bad this was a good movie.
  While it has a few imaginative moments, Monster Trucks crashes and burns with a recycled story, forgettable characters, really dated CGI, and incredibly forced humor, it's a film that reeks of Diesel and low thought!
  I went to a presceening of this movie. It is hilarious and in my opinion is funnier than the first one.
  Furiosa And The Five Wives Of Fury Road is a piece of shit
  Fantasy dystopian desert adventure in which the bad guys are stupid, ugly and shit shots and the good guys n gals never miss. Plenty of old vehicles that never break down and a script that involves a lot of grunting. Nothing in this film makes sense and it's more attractive feature is the warped surreal landscapes - though most of it looks like the Atakama.
  Far too slow for my liking ??
  An iconic classic that deserves the highest praise for setting the foundation for many other great films. It's stunning color feature creates many eye popping scenes and beautifully accentuates the already memorable characters.
  yeah the first one was better, yeah this was alot of the same...this was still a solid funny flick that had my wife and I laughing throughout
  Great songs, good fun and utterly timeless. Even the kids sat and watched to the very end. Ding dong!
  Visually impeccable and with some good action scenes, but when you eliminate the philosofal questions of the source material, Ghost in the Shell is a movie without a soul and sense of entertainenment. Even with fine performances of the cast and some interesting moments, the movie never delivers. (2,5/5)
  Lejos de la artificiosidad y el academicismo de obras como "La Chica Danesa" o "The Imitation Game", así como del cansino drama social de nulo interés artístico, "Moonlight" supone un auténtico acercamiento a la figura de su protagonista, al que retrata con una sensibilidad que pocas veces tenemos ocasión de ver en este tipo de cine oscarizable. Si nos ponemos a analizar superficialmente, "Moonlight" no deja de ser una película sobre una persona que, tras muchos palos y esfuerzo, logra aceptarse a sí misma. Lo que la convierte en una obra muy notable es precisamente que no se queda ahí, sino que realiza una verdadera radiografía social, tratando situaciones como el acoso escolar, la pobreza, la drogadicción y, sobre todo, la homosexualidad, sin que podamos percibir (y esto es de agradecer) el mínimo atisbo de fetichización, tocando el tema con gran naturalidad, dentro de la anomalía que supone la homosexualidad en el entorno del protagonista.Una de las principales críticas que he leído sobre la película es que cae demasiado en los tópicos. Sí, se vale de algunos tópicos para hacer avanzar la trama, pero por otra parte es lógico, puesto que aunque nos empeñemos en lo contrario, los clichés en el cine existen porque, de alguna forma u otra, se aproximan a la realidad. "Moonlight" no es una excepción, y la verdad es que funcionan. La película en ningún momento se siente disparatada o impensable, sino que es absolutamente factible y, de hecho, bastante probable, que la historia que cuenta sea muy similar a la de muchas personas. A mí personalmente no me importa lo más mínimo el uso moderado de clichés, pues la película está tan bien narrada y me resulta tan sincera y honesta en lo que quiere transmitir que conecto con ella en todo momento. Me parece además un gran acierto el haber estructurado la película en tres grandes partes completamente diferenciadas (lo cual no deja de ser un introducción-nudo-desenlace de manual), pues esto permite un uso mucho más libre de las elipsis, en mi opinión sabiamente utilizadas, obteniendo como resultado una más que correcta narración... aunque, eso sí, con sus pequeños altibajos, especialmente en el tercer y último tercio.Cabe destacar también una estupenda fotografía, que da lugar a escenas de gran fuerza e impacto visual, incluyendo algunas verdaderamente poéticas.Poco más que decir, para mí una de las mejores películas de 2016. Habrá que seguir de cerca al tal Jenkins...
  It is a great movie, the critics are wrong ! I can't wait for the extended version, I am certain it will be even better. The exit polls seem to be getting better as well, never take the so called critics at their word, you may miss out on a lot of fun !
  1 1/2 ud af 5 slagsværd. Guy Ritchie voldtager Arthur-myterne i en kaotisk togkollision af en freudiansk musikvideo på svampe.
  Woody Allen has directed about 53 films, averaging one a year for the past 50 years, and about 1 out of 5 are very good or excellent, 30 bearable to watch and the rest are pretty bad, to which he can add "Wonder Wheel". It is as if he didn't give Justin Timberlake any direction and just told Kate Winslet to be Cate Blanchett in "Blue Jasmine", who was a rip-off of Blanche Dubois in "A Streetcar Named Desire", and it is the first time I can remember feeling she was just doing a bad acting job or was, at least, in a different movie. Seeing either of them on screen, saying trite sentences, was painful except for some beautiful lit headshots of her. Who sabotages her most is Woody Allen, the writer, with some of the tritest sentences ever uttered on screen with poor imitations of Williams, Eugene O'Neill and others.Jim Belushi seemed to be a combination of Stanley, without the body but the attitude, and Mitch in "Streetcar", while Juno Temple starts off as an uninteresting part of the film but develops her character nicely as the film comes towards the finish.Now if I could only figure out why Jack Gore, as a child from Winslet's first husband, is a pyromaniac and why he is even in the movie.Without getting into the whole Woody Allen-Mia Farrow-Dylan Farrow-Soon-Yi Previn aspects which is reflected in today's news this is definitely one of Allen's worst pictures as a director and writer and, for the first time, I felt Allen even got the music track wrong, completely annoying.The stars of "Wonder Wheel" are not Allen but cinematographer Vittoria Storaro and Santo Loquasto the production designer.
  A masterpiece that will never be forgotten.
  A theatrical experience
  Fun, fast, energic! Great movie!
  bad acting, mixed with weak story telling, painful edit cuts, literally painfully went through some of these exhibition scenes. uninteresting and unoriginal trannabe franchise that I hope will never see the light again.
  Great movie great special affects action packed very entertaining.
  Some good action sequences and effects but the movie suffers from rather juvenile story tricks or dialogues or mythical connections every now and then.
  There Are Times When A Film Is So Engrossing and Immersive, Not Just With Visual Flair, But With Raw Perfect Talent Given By Both The Actors And Crew, You Have No Choice But To Say: "Holy S#$T". That's Exactly What I Did At The End Of This Film.10 / 10 Yes Its Effects Driven, But Includes An Amazingly Emotional Storyline and Atmosphere.
  Great movie don't ever listen to rotten tomatoes smh
  I can't believe this won best picture. Started off good but worsened as it went on, only to find this movie is a story about a gay man...smh disappointed.
  This film did not need to be made. The films existence is offensive.
  In my opinion this move is so slow and boring. Very overrated. Naomi performance is still great. I can't understand why this film won the Oscar instead of La La Land.
  Moonlight doesn't feel like a scripted film, it feels real - and has a very important story to tell.
  Critics are being very harsh. This film is well written, has great action and acting. The effects are brilliant and the movie score is one of the best, up their with the greatest. The story is a fresh take on King Arthur and by far the best film version since Excalibur. I could watch this again and enjoy it just as much. My daughter loved it as well, so one for the kids and the parents. Go see it and let's hope this film gets the planned sequels it rightly deserves!
  very well done retelling of the old tale!
  With no title screen till the end again, that is just a stupid way to do movies these days. This was no where as good as the first one. This time it is all about the grandmas and how each one ruins the moms christmas. I did not find this as funny as the first one. There were some moments but most of them just sucked. No really a good comedy. Watch the first one and not this one. All I am ever going to remember from this movie is the kid saying oh my f****** god like 5 times.
  Wonderful musical numbers, innovative set pieces and a wise and magical narrative makes The Wizard of Oz a classic for all audiences.
  I own the four disc DVD and the two disc Blu-Ray
  Coming into this film I didn't know too much about it. I knew that it is a film set in different stages in a man's life, and he's trying to find himself. It seemed interesting, but once I saw the praise it was getting I had to look into it. Although I thought the whole Best Picture fiasco was horrible for the awards show, I am tremendously happy that Moonlight ended up winning Best Picture. The reason why is because it is an absolutely beautiful film. The acting is phenomenal, and I really believe that Viola should've been in the Best Actress in a Leading Role category, with Naomie Harris then winning Supporting Actress, but I digress. The cinematography and direction is stunning throughout, and the narrative as a whole is beautiful to follow. All three actors that played Chiron were tremendous, and I'm glad Mahershala Ali won an Oscar for his role. This is both an important film and a truly emotional film. This is my favorite film of 2016, and it is definitely one of my favorite films of all-time.
  My favourite movie of all time. A cinematic masterpiece
  much better than the first...hysterical
  Fun loving Guy Ritchie take on the old tale and a killer soundtrack. some slow parts to complete the story but all round enjoyable and some sweet CGI
  I don't knew where the best part of this film who make 80% people like this.
  Changed too much from the anime for me to like it.
  If you keep in mind how old this movie is, and compare it to movies that came out throughout the next 40 years, you'd agree this movie was ahead of it's time. Who hasn't seen this movie? Out of all of the people I've known to have a tv has seen, or even grew up with this movie, and it's no surprise. It is like a family tradition to pass this movie's existence to their kids and grandkids. It is the first achievement in animation history, it's the first movie to be shown in living color, to use convincing live staging effects, and it had a fun cast of characters and music. Imagine growing up in the late 1930s. The world of films were slowly emerging, and all people saw were black and white movies. Back then, these people had no TVs or computers to tell them about upcoming movies, all they had were newspapers, and movie posters. People just came across how The Wizard of Oz was playing, they decided to see what the big deal is. It starts off as a simple colorless movie, but imagine being one of the few who saw it's original release, and how they couldn't believe their eyes when the movie starts showing in color.
  Back in 1981 The Road Warrior rewrote the formula for action films, and now in 2015 Fury Road rewrites the formula for films altogether. This insane 120 minute ride of pure adrenaline is about as close to perfection as there is. The greatest 80's action film to not come out of the 80's.
  You cannot hate this movie, or else you will not be accepted into society. I loved it so much that I bought the book (The Wonderful Wizard of Oz By L. Frank Baum) and read it millions of times. In fact, I am reading the entire series of the books.
  Gorgeous. Astonishing detail. Can't wait to see it again.
  Can't believe critics scorned this movie! I loved it! I may not watch it again, but it was a fast paced mivie.Beautiful scenery, great fight scenes, Jude Law and Guy Ritchie! Lots of fun to watch!
  Not as good as I thought it would be. Very slow. Would've loved to see more of Mahershala Ali.
  THE BEST FILM OF 2016! A coming-of-age piece that tells its main character's compelling life-story with three defining chapters of his life, and does so with spellbinding passion.
  This film is one of the most quintessential classics of cinema. Chances are that you've seen it aired every Thanksgiving, or you've seen clips of it all over the place, of you've heard the songs sung and resung, or you've seen parodies. The Wizard of Oz has become so ingrained in American culture that the film, its scenes, its characters, its music, its dialogue, and just about everything is instantly recognizable and endearing.To be perfectly honest, this is a really short and silly film. The comedy, especially with so many silly lines, is still hilarious to this day. There is peril and adventure in short bursts, and such scenes have become seriously iconic. Frequently catchy musical numbers add to the overall whimsey of the picture. There's hardly a dull moment in this film, and most moments are memorable and fun.The story is a short and simple affair. It takes a stretch to believe something this fantastic, but the film plays things so straight that it successfully immerses the audience. Characters aren't terribly deep or fleshed-out, but they stand out really well. In the end, it's the themes that count. On one hand, it's a fundamental fantasy adventure: the classic there-and-back-again tale, in which the characters embark on their journey and come back stronger and wiser. With the film's ending, such themes are made even stronger, when it's revealed that it may have all been in Dorothy's dream. The big reveal for the actual wizard of Oz is also a thematically strong moment, as it underscores a key theme regarding magic and imagination; it's a theme that not only extends to the characters of the story, but also reaches beyond the screen and demonstrates movie-making magic on a fundamental level. If there's any thematic weakness, it's purely in the very very end, when Dorothy concludes that it's much better to stay at home than it is to have an adventure (she almost makes it sound like she'll be a recluse from then on, which kinda defeats the purpose of everything, in my opinion).This film is well-filmed with steady and solid photography. It's most distinctive for utilizing both black-and-white and color photography together, to create a stark contrast between reality and fantasy. Acting is extremely goofy and over-the-top, but it all works for the film's benefit. It's always a hoot to watch Margaret Hamilton as the iconic villain, while Judy Garland and the rest of the cast provide much zeal and spirit to their roles. Writing is pretty silly, but it builds the story really well and features some very memorable lines. This production uses some rather limited sets, props, and costumes, many of which are outlandish and very fake-looking, but provide enough of an illusion to craft a vibrant spectacle with limited resources. Music is catchy and memorable.This movie is a must-see, if for no other reason than for its prestige and popularity throughout the decades. Highly recommended!4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)
  A classic! A must see for every child and those young at heart.
  Three overburdened young moms try to meet and then rebel against the challenges of Super Bowl for moms" - a perfect Christmas.It's a sequel to Bad Moms" released in 2016 summer which turned out to be quite a breakout hit, earning over 180 million cinema dollars against the 20 mil budget.Ah, the grrl power comedies, the cute but mostly unfunny younger sister of American mainstream comedies which were kickstarted by 2011's hit Bridesmaid", and Hollywood's eager wish to prove that women can be funny too.Well anybody can funny, of course, but you can't really create a noteworthy all-female comedy without decent script and performances, and/or actresses' ability to improvise, and this is where the new grrl power comedies fall short usually.A Bad Moms Christmas" is a good example of this. Like many mainstream comedies, it has enough of everything to get the ball rolling, but the result feels so humorless and lacking that you will probably start checking your watch/phone before it reaches midpoint, at latest.One problem is the generic screenplay, the other is the fact that despite all the talent involved, the story centers on three leading ladies, two of which are not good enough performers to carry this movie.Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell are always decent supporters but they lack the acting range and presence to justify carrying a comedy. I am not even sure that they have enough star power to justify lead parts in a budding comedy franchise.So it's up to third lead Kathryn Hahn to do most of the the heavy lifting, and she's solid as usual, being able to entertain, display some acting chops and create emotional connection with the audience.All the other players are relegated to the sidelines, and have little screen time or almost nothing interesting to do. But they do it well, so I am gonna name them all:* Christine Baranski, Susan Sarandon, and Cherly Hines as the bad moms of the bad moms visiting for Christmas - all veteran actresses, all giving much better performances than Bell and Kunis;* Jay Hernandez, Peter Gallagher, Justin Hartley, Lyle Brocato - various love interests of bad moms, mostly there for decoration. Hartley is surprisingly memorable as male stripper with golden heart.The introduction of his character, an affectionate conversation during balls and anus waxing, is probably the best part of the whole movie, both warm and funny. I was as surprised as you probably are reading this.* Wanda Sykes, Christina Applegate, Cade Mansfield Cooksey - quick comedy reliefs, little screen time but a great value to the whole movie. If Bad Moms 2" will make you laugh at all, then it would probably happen thanks to them.I've seen some good modern christmas comedies, such as Elf" and The Bad Santa", but this is not one of them. A Bad Moms Christmas" is just never funny.The first hour is watchable but unremarkable, the remaining 45 minutes are just too cliche-y and frankly boring to care.Also, I was surprised to find that "Bad Moms 2" is rated R in the U.S. cinemas - for crude sexual content and language throughout, and some drug use. Because compared to possibly every other modern raunchy comedy I have seen, it sure feels meek and mild. They even manage to make the promising end-credits dance number as unsexy as possible.So... Avoid it, till it reaches Netflix or something, or when you desperately need some comedy you haven't seen yet.By the way, Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, the writing-directing team behind the franchise, are already planning the spin-off Bad Dads".Probably gonna be as hollow and sackless as, say, Horrible Bosses". I am surprised if they will not try to bring in Jason Sudeikis or Jason Bateman, the charming crownprinces of sackless modern comedy movies.
  Excellent job of bringing back an old iconic movie back
  Really enjoyed it was funny but to the point at the same time and action scenes for fighting.
  I just don't see anything special about this overly odd, violent, and over the top action flick that did nothing to excite me, and at times made me laugh unintentionally.
  be silenced 'TOP CRITICS' .. for those who paid the price of a ticket, we have spoken. FUN and great suits of armor were seen. Amazing camera work for medieval times. Guy Richie can come stay at my house for free.
  Awful film... I stopped watching it because the Major is supposed to be headstrong and reeks confidence... yet what I see is she's portrayed as a confused soul who plays the victim card. I cringed on my seat... NOT WORTH IT!
  Amazing movie it was everything I hoped it would be and more.
  The fact that this movie has better ratings than lord of the rings, (and just about every other movie) is ridiculous
  I'm late to seeing this film, but I am so glad that I did. Of everything that I'll say about this film, I want to say that I appreciate this film for portraying very nuanced emotions and not creating a hyper-dramatic piece to shock audiences. When discussing something as sensitive as LGBTQ people of color, I believe it should be handled with care. In the end, Chiron feels like a real human being, not a cinematic one.All of the performances in this film were wonderful, so wonderful that I could not stop watching once I started.The music and cinematography were both completely on point as well. Once I finished watching, I felt like I had watched the birth, death, and rebirth of a soul. It was so true to someone's experience that I felt physically heavy throughout the film. I fully believe anyone seeking an authentic experience should watch this film.
  Woody Allen seems to reflect his awareness of authors O'Neill and Fitzgerald in this rather morbid story. The Wonderwheel overshadows much of the sad drama which unfolds for the audience, somewhat reminiscent of the billboard of T.J. Eckleburg functions in The Great Gatsby. The actors' performances stand alone for audience satisfaction, but let us leave the theater wondering why we were there otherwise.
  A classic among classics the wizard of oz while it still has plot holes holds up and remains a fantastic film. A+.
  Wow! What a totally original idea. Put a timeless classic in IMAX, wonderful inventiveness Hollywood
  A relatively messy style of story telling but is good enough for a lazy afternoon with low expectations.
  Guy Ritchie's style oddly meshes with this effects heavy action adventure that entertains throughout. King Arthur isn't a gamechanger, but it does most of what it sets out to do well enough. The acting, visuals, and most of the action and setpieces are a joy to behold. Some better scripting and at times tighter tweaking of the pacing would've elevated the film.
  i have very low expectations for this movie. from the trailer i can tell it will be filled with bad cgi, a plot similar to transformers age of extinction, bad acting and bad character development
  A good story about people that come together to do the right thing. My family loved it. Ignore the critics.
  An enjoyable movie!I wasn't expecting much but I do enjoy Guy Ritchie's characters recapping events. They are always entertaining.
  Would have struggled to sit through it without Scarlett perhaps..
  Ignore the negative reviews from picky people - this is a good, fun adventure movie.I hope they make more.
  This film holds so many wonderful childhood memories...it is a firm family favourite, even after so many years since its release...an excellent film to be enjoyed by the whole family.
  One of the best classics
  Very disappointed. This film starts out just as good as the first left off and after the grandma's show up everything including the story and the jokes just fall flat.
  Great movie and really saddens me that there will not be a sequal this was a fresh take on the story and the type of movie is what the move industry needs its gritty and badass and a change from the over saturation of super hero movies at the moment
  Fantastic scifi movie, visuals are incredible, the action is really cool, good soundtrack, good acting, good plot. No reason for these low reviews that other people have given.
  I'm not a fan of the Mad Max franchise, but "Fury Road" was excellent! "Mad Max: Fury Road" has a decent story (albeit with plot holes aplenty) and interesting characters with marvelous costume, makeup and special effects. It's truly spectacular.
  The first one was much better. Barely laughed...
  Cannot begin to express how disappointing this movie is. What a waste of perfectly good talent, just never comes together. The previews are very deceptive as every hint of a laugh was there, nothing extra in the film and even those scenes, in context, are not so funny.
  The Wizard of Oz (1939) C-101m. ???? D: Victor Fleming. Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley, Billie Burke, Margaret Hamilton, Terry (Todo). Movie magic as sweet girl (and kawaii dog) are swept away to mystical land of Oz where delight and friendliness at every turn is varnished by an evil witch. With the help of a Scarecrow, a Tin Woodman, and Lion, she can restore Oz to greatness, but she just wants to go back to her family. Super casting, legendary scoring . . . you just can't beat this film! "Over the Rainbow" number and Herbert Stothart's soaring music won richly deserved Academy Awards. Based on the L. Frank Baum novels; followed by RETURN TO OZ in 1985. And has there ever been a more winning selection of characters?
  This movie is HORRIBLE. Boring, pointless, full of stereotypes and PC baloney. His mother is a prostitute and drug addict. Really?? Wow that's original. We walked out of a movie for the first time since District 9.
  That is now one of my favourite movies!!
  Scarlet Johansson strikes again
  Very disappointed sorryTo say... very bad movie shocked that some of the A listStars participated in this movie !
  Great acting, above average script. Not best picture in my opinion. This movie is the epitome of less is more
  My 2nd favorite movie of all time!!
  96%A classic for ages to come, The Wizard of Oz combines artful script writing and musical magic to create one of the greatest cinematic achievements in all memory.
  I think they were in a desperate need to put Johansson in a skin suit.
  As undeserving of an Academy award as Trump is of the presidency.
  So much fun! I loved every minute. I laughed, I cried, I peed my pants!
  So i know what you're probably thinking... "here we go again with yet another rendition of the King Arthur story". And i get it, it's exactly what I thought when I wasn't impressed too much by the trailers and when the poor reviews came out. But what director Guy Ritchie does here by bringing his style of filmmaking and a 21st century feel to this familiar story makes for a very engaging, fun, and enjoyable ride that I for one didn't expect. Charlie Hunnam plays Arthur and leads an impressive cast from Jude Law (Vortigern) to Djimon Hounsou (Sir Bedivere) who all put in strong performances in a film that takes itself seriously enough to where it can still have a great deal of fun within the fantasy world. The film follows Arthur who fights his way to prominence whilst dealing with acknowledging his legacy in order to face his uncle Vortigern who has since seized the crown that was once his fathers. Visually it is incredible, there is some light humour spread throughout, and there is just so much excitement to be had with this movie. I will begin with the star of the film who is without a doubt Guy Ritchie, his distinct style is very evident throughout all or most scenes and it is the reason you are able to separate this film from the other Arthurian legends. He utilises a style that brings a modern atmosphere to a classic tale and time period making it a very fun time but still retaining the core components of the legend. A few times during the film he utilises a fast paced montages extremely effectively and for a number of reasons. One being to obviously skip ahead a large amount of time whilst still understanding the important events that occurred, and another reason was to make potentially boring sequences fast paced interesting. Rather than telling some events in a strictly linear format he very successfully represents the pre-planning stage, planning stage, and execution stage of an action sequence all within the same montage of scenes in a very upbeat way. Without Guy Ritchie's involvement this probably would have been as dull and bland as it appeared to be from the outset. The cast here involves some big names, all of whom deliver with their characters whether that be in a main or more supporting role. Some of the very well executed supporting performances include those by Djimon Hounsou (Sir Bedivere), Aidan Gillen (Goosefat Bill), and Astrid Berges-Frisbey (The Mage) who were all very fun to watch and I was able to get behind their likeable characters. Aidan Gillen I wasn't sure was cast accurately when the film began but as time went on I warmed up to his character more and more. Jude Law plays the big villain and he proves again can successfully play a very good villain as he brings a sense of personality to a character who could have been just super serious evil guy #31. Charlie Hunnam who plays the lead is by far the highlight and plays a very likeable lead to where you are rooting for this guy the entire time, and not just because he is Arthur. He deals with a very fun and charismatic personality and can still deliver on the more serious personal choices his character faces. One thing I also want to note is that this movie is visually phenomenal. Everything in this world looked so damn real it was hard to admit at some points that certain elements were CGI. From the landscapes to the large castles to large creatures everything looked spot on. Now I know where the majority of the monstrous $175M budget was spent. One role I want to bring up is Annabelle Wallis' role in the film, I was pleasantly surprised to see that she was in the movie and then to see that she has only a handful of short scenes and doesn't really do much was a little disappointing I must admit. I for one wouldn't mind seeing a sequel set in the world or even a prequel set during the opening scene with Eric Bana and Jude Law's characters. But considering the film bombed and failed to make back its budget at the box office there is next to no way that is going to happen. So in the end I think it's safe to say i was incredibly surprised by how much I enjoyed this damn movie. I thought it would be dull, slow, and just a very bland King Arthur story but it's the complete opposite of that. It was fast paced, engaging, fun, and the implementation of Ritchie's light humour made the whole thing very upbeat. I was waiting for a drop in quality somewhere, not because I wanted it rather because I didn't think it could keep up the act for two whole hours. But it does and i have to say, disregard the reviews and if you are a fan of these types of films especially the King Arthur story check this out because it is considerably better than it is made out to be. 7.7/10
  Mad max fury road is really good, it's so much fun and whatever that stuff
  How did this movie get rated so highly? If you're 15 or under and like constant 5 second violent action clips continuously with little to no story line "except getting to the green", go for it. What a disappointment from the early first two. Horrible. I'm glad I saw it for free. It was hard to sit through the whole debacle.
  As a huge fan of the source manga,I can't endorse this visually stunning,but ultimately heart and soulless production.
  Great film it was different recommended to watch
  I liked the story and as usual Guy Ritchie does not disappoint
  One of the greatest films ever made!
  I've seen all of the animated films and television shows; as such I am a big fan of the show. Going into this movie I had pretty high expecations but was ultimately let down. What disappointed me the most was Scarlett Johansson's portrayal of the Major. For example, the Major in this film comes off as too emotionally driven whereas in the animated films the Major comes across as more cool, calm, and collected. It's her portrayal of the Major that made it hard for me to really enjoy this film. That said, I do not think the film is that bad overall.
  Awesome action and adventure! Great kids movie!!
  Critics are out to lunch on this one. Very entertaining take on the old and previously pompously retold legend. Fun to see Ritchie's take on the noble but in a very ruffian way King Arthur.
  How did this even get nominated?
  I don't get all the love for this movie. For a film with an R-rating, his could have been way more violent.
  Absolutely love this film
  A brilliant, family-friendly film for the holidays; Herbie meets ET meets Scooby.
  favorite childhood movie!! =]
  really enjoyed it at the cinema, does not deserve the poor critics.
  BEST PICTURE 2016: Powerful drama about a black gay man growing up. Chiron goes on a discovery to find who he really is through a troubled upbringing and finding it difficult to fit in at school.
  #WhiteWashing lol I didn't feel any sentimentals towards this movie due to the fact that she was white actress playing an Asian woman. it didn't make sense with her mom being Asian and such lol didn't feel the connection between them. I only gave it two because I liked the action
  It's one of the most cinematically, culturally, and historically significant films of all time, and that's no overstatement. The Wizard of Oz should be witnessed by all, who will treasure its groundbreaking cinematography and special effects, unforgettable soundtrack, and excellent storytelling that's timeless to date.
  Fuck yah! Monster trucks are life! I love my truck, I call her the Big Balls of Death! Fuckkkk yah!!! I love my dog Greta, she is so cute!
  The best action movie in decades. That being said, action is not all this movie has going for it. It actually has a surprising amount of feeling to it with Charlize Theron's character.Tom Hardy took over the Max Rockatansky role is great and really surprised me. For a person who had never previously seen a Mad Max film, i was so happy with how this movie turned out.
  Gave up after fifteen minutes; an attempted mash-up of a LOTR ripoff and an "Excalibur" ripoff. Just awful!
  I just saw this in IMAX and was thrilled to see how much I have missed in the years of past viewing. Every freckle on Dorothy, each dent and scratch on the Tinman, close ups of the fantastic Make-up on the Scarecrow, and each wonderfully twisted curl of the Cowardly Lion. Mid way through this film I realized that it should have been shot in 3D to begin with. The sets are all produced to force perspective soooo well that the 3D simply clarifies and tells the truth about each camera angle. Inward depth of this film is extraordinary and Looks totally planned for 3D shooting. The beginning of the film terrified me with the best special effects beyond what I have seen in any modern movie. When Dorothy finds the cellar door during the Twister scene, you will pee your pants just wanting to save her from the giant menace of a twister. Kansas appears flat and lonely like we have never before been able to distinguish. But when Dorothy lands her house and opens her front door into OZ, YOU WILL BE FLOORED. This is the first time seeing OZ that I truly felt like I was there. YES, this grown man teared up simply because of the Technical Beauty that was being displayed, and YES because I really did want to believe it was real. This is the way this movie should have been produced had we had the technology. Don't question it, just go see it and you too will be amazed! THANK YOU TO IMAX AND THEIR AFFILIATES .
  My 10 year old gives it 5 stars. It was fun. The creatures were cute.
  Saw the first one three times and have seen this one once (have plans to go next week). As long as you know what to expect you will love it. My 79-year-old mother (who thinks crap is a bad word) laughed so hard she cried at both of them.
  Quite a pleasant surprise to be honest. Similar to the first, everyone's entitled to an opinion so if you enjoyed first I think you'll like this one too.
  Best movie of all time!
  I was entertained and I'd go see a sequel if they made one.
  It's very good but it still terrifies me.
  Not a fan. I had high expectations for this movie because it won an Oscar, but the movie was so choppy. It didn't prove to be the artsy cinematic artistic type that I am a fan of. Would not watch it again. Sadly disappointed
  It was ok. But a little off
  This Is one of the most dumbest, laziest, unfunniest, unoriginalest films I've seen In quite some time, please don't see this movie, It's not worth It, It's stupid as hell and It's not worth the money...
  I love a bawdy, cheesy holiday movie but this is just pathetic. By the end of the movie, you're only wondering how much money these women got to debase themselves with such a horrible script.
  One of the most disappointing and depressing films I have seen in many years. I get it. Woody Allen finds angst really appealing. I don't. This is a study in grimey, hopeless misery. I was hoping Kate Winslet and Justin Timberlake would offer strong performances. They didn't. Jim Belushi was routinely awkward. The only redeeming aspect of the film was the F/X that recreated 1950s Coney Island. The rest was a pretentious, artsy exercise in Woody Allen's self-indulgence.
  Long hair.. short hair.. long hair.. short hair.....
  Unique, thoroughly entertaining, and above all - batshit insane.
  Mad Max: Fury Road-The name of the film is Fury Road. It was directed by George Miller and themain characters are Mad Max who is played by Tom Hardy, Furiosa who isplayed by Charlize Theron and Nux who is played by Nicholas Hoult.-Years after the collapse of civilization, the tyrannical Immortan Joe enslavesapocalypse survivors inside the desert fortress called the Citadel. When thewarrior Imperator Furiosa leads the despot's five wives in a daring escape, sheforges an alliance with Max, a loner and former captive. Fortified in themassive, armored truck the War Rig, they try to outrun the ruthless warlord andhis henchmen in a deadly high-speed chase through the Wasteland.-The plot seems to be absorbing.-The special effects are outstanding and stunning.-The photography is really incredible and impressive.-The acting performance is spectacular, believable and powerful.-The writting script is thought-provoking, compelling and moving.-I find this film absolutely fascinating and compelling. If you haven't seen ityet, you don't know what you have been missing. Fury Road is one of myfavourite films in the world.
  Let?s be real, no one is going to see this movie to see a cinematic masterpiece. But it?s entirely on par with the first movie and absolutely hilarious and a really enjoyable movie for a girls date during the holidays!!
  Exactly as expected, sadly. All visual gloss, but no feeling or meaning behind it all. It just felt so empty. Yes, I did see the original movie, and enjoyed it a lot., It had mood, feeling, urgency. This has none of that. Scarlet is fine in the role of The Major, but she still felt out of place somehow. Like an Asian actress would have fit the role better. The guy who plays Batou was freaking perfect. I dug the ScI-fi technopunk CG world from a purely visual perspective. It makes you want to go there and be a part of it. It's too bad it's just so empty otherwise. The story was kind of weak in the original and it still is here. It's a minor blip in a much bigger potential narrative about AI and how it will affect the future of society. I hated how the scriptwriters felt the need to explain the title multiple times. Like we're stupid and don't get what it would mean otherwise. Then we have the whole name thing. Her name is NOT Major. She is A Major, but everyone keeps calling her Major with the THE attached. I cringed every time I heard it.
  Great googley moogley! What a spectacle! Solid acting drives the action sequences which are high-key and fast-cut. Multi-layered so all can enjoy; if you need dramatic backstory? Its there - you just have to dig for it and not expect to get spoon fed. You just want to see cars go boom? That's there too. If you like both of those aspects you will be shiny and chrome all the way to Valhalla. Brilliant direction drives the stunning imagery. I can see how it's similar to The Road Warrior, but it feels less so in the end, but comparing to the original is oddly enough an apples-to-oranges comparison. Hardy plays it great but Theron steals the show. Strong yet human and real and tougher than you, she delivers through and through.. Her portrait of Furiosa is nothing short of epic and it's her sub-plot that drives most of the movie. Even the redemption of the warboy outshines Max. Using Max as the pallet to mix the other stories is a brilliant bit of film making. There was no need to make this a Mad Max movie and I suspect it was a device Miller needed to get the studios on board. They just could have made a new movie titled after the main character, which isn't Max. Its super-fantastic! Best film of the year for me.
  I thought she he first one was ok and it was good enough to make me want to see this movie. Looks funnier than the first one.
  The chemistry of Mila and her friends is just so awesome. These movies are a great series, and one that i really don't seem to get tired of watching!
  Love this sequel- it has comedy and insight if mother-daughter relationship.
  My early plan to watch Sam Raimi's OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL (2013) has been successfully foiled by the tepid reviews and in fear of another ALICE IN WONDERLAND (2010, 6/10) travesty, then it stroke to me that I had never even watched the worldly-famous 1939 version, it must be a presumably safe and better alternative. I'm indisputably way past the age which will be exalting to watch this family-friendly vaudeville for the very first time, I wish I could have done that around my childhood year so I would be more in shock-and-awe admiration for this haute crowd-pleaser and ground-breaking studio-based product. It all begins in Kansas, young Dorothy lives in a farm with his uncle and auntie, (after a melancholic rendition of OVER THE RAINBOW, still astounding and flawless) her tentative runaway with her cuddly puppy Toto has been persuaded by Professor Marvel (a very first introduction of multi-personae performance from Frank Morgan), en route, a twister rampages the farm and Dorothy and Toto (along with the house) has been brought to Wizard Oz's wonderland with the casualty of a star-crossed wicked witch (crushed by the house accidentally), and the shoddy superimposition of the airborne journey may be cutting-edge 74 years earlier, sadly it barely works even under an uncritical eye.  The tangible visual transference from sepia farmland to the variegated Oz land grants a soothing refreshment and heralds a jovial adventure ahead, sing-a-longs with DING DONG THE WITCH IS DEAD (new entry at No. 2 in this week at UK Singles Chart in the wake of Thatcher's death), it is just carefree and mollifying one's hard-pressed nerves (if you have those). Then the classic characters (Scarecrow, Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion) successively accompany Dorothy to meet the great and mighty Oz.  Despite of its all-comprising industry-reeking indoor design, it is a marvel how the film could be made in such a laborious scale and obedient order at its time, entering the second half of the film, when insouciant singing-and-dancing gives its way to the escapade of taking back the broomstick of The Wicked Witch of the West, all the set pieces are incontrovertibly stale and the logic of the story sags into an untenable farce (no specific elucidation of how the witch would succumb to a basin of water or what is so special about the red shoes the witch is hankering for, et al). The guarded-gate of the witch's castle must be the recipient of the homage from Sauron's gate from THE LORD OF THE RINGS.Acting-wise, Judy Garland is humble, mawkish but naturalistic in delivering jejune lines, Bert Lahr's Lion and Ray Bolger's Scarecrow otherwise are the film's best offers, also Margaret Hamilton's heinous witch, simply wish she had more venom to spill. Overall, it is a cartoon-ish adaption of children's best-known bedtime story, may be predisposed to be an overrated sensation which stands flimsily after a serious filmic anatomy, but the bent of director Victor Fleming and his crew has been testified positively through the arduous endeavour, and one can still relish 75-or-so years after its inception.
  Boring. La La Land should have won.
  no coherent story line. Super CGI but woeful adhesion of story. All over the place with good actors
  An incredibly tender, nuanced and beautiful film.
  This is a late review, and has spoilers FYI. I held off on seeing this because of the overall negative reception. I'm so glad I held off. I saw a lot of things about Whitewashing, which are apparent. That is not the problem with this movie. The problem is how much they destroyed the story, and what made GitS more than just an action movie. It was interesting. The original Anime delved into A.I. becoming conscious and growing beyond the limits man had set, and becoming something altogether new, and also touched on what Rights a being have if it believes itself to be conscious and deserving of rights. Thus the name "Ghost (Soul) in the Shell", just like Ghost in the Machine. This movie takes a shit on that whole business, and decides...lets remake the movie, keep the actions seens we think are cool, and make the story about putting a human brain in a shell, and so yea, you have a Ghost in the Shell. Thanks for continuing to pander to the lowest common denominator. Sure it was well done visually. But...The dialogue was atrocious, the action scenes were your typically chopped up multi cut fest, the story line was lobotomized, and the ending was just dumb. The 54% of people who liked this movie, either A: only go to movies to see pretty lights for two hours, and give no shits about having their brain engaged. or...B: Just enjoy seeing a pretty face and pretty lights, and to them that makes a good movie.  This gets 2 and half stars, because the visuals were quite nice.
  Definitely worth the investment of time and money! Excellent, fun, exciting cast- Guy Ritchie antics that create a whirlwind of action and timeliness that brings you into the world of soon-to-be King Arthur. His direction and vision of a legend inthe making, comes through with visceral color! Charlie H. is excellent in his protrayal of King Arthur, along with a demonic Jude Law and very brief siting of Eric Baña (always a favorite). It seems poised to be followed by a few more journeys into this appealing, magic filled fantasyland- can't wait!
  If there is any film that has been made that has stood the test of time its the timeless classic, "The Wizard Of Oz''. Directed by Victor Fleming and King Vidor, this film was one of the first films made that really pushed the envelope on special effects and grand scale. So much heart was put into this. I haven't met anyone who doesn't love this film.Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland) is a young Kansas girl who lives on a farm. After her dog Toto is taken from her by Miss Gulch (Margret Hamilton), the dog returns. Not knowing what to do, Dorothy and Toto run away. When they return, a tornado is rapidly approaching the farmhouse. Dorothy is knocked unconscious. When she awakes, she has been whisked away to the magical land of Oz, and must save the land from the evil Wicked Witch, with the help of some unlikely heroes. The acting in this film is superb and iconic. While Judy Garland isn't perfect, and her acting is a little over the top, she goes a pretty darn good job. Her companions include Ray Bolger ( The Scarecrow), Jack Haley (The Tin Man), and Bert Lahr (The Cowardly Lion). These gentlemen do a splendid job. The set pieces are magnificent. Also, this film has astounding piratical effects. From the back drops, the tornado, and costumes, everything is top- notch and every detail is paid attention to. "The Wizard Of Oz'' is a timeless film that touches the heart of everyone. It has memorable charming songs, great acting, impressive special effects, and shows that the old films are still, at times and in some ways, the best.
  A terrible, nonsensical story with the title character mostly along for the ride.
  Joyous, entertaining, and perfect family fun, The Wizard of Oz is a musical masterpiece that'll forever delight audiences with its magic!
  So much talent gone to waste. How many times do you need to hear a ten year girl say "oh my f@cking God?" Sad way to start the Holiday Season, with this crap.
  I know why it is relevant, I know why it is praised, and I know it is not my kinda movie.
  Worst King Arthur movie of all time
  Quality movie. Best movie of 2017
  Good movie Mad max the best
  Great! Not as amazing as the critics said, 4 stars is a reasonable rating!
  Look, just forget the fact that t hey grab a few historical characters and completely get them wrong, both in character, sequence and just about anything else. This is just a rollicking good yarn and I loved it. I w as nearly put off by t he bad reviews, I am so glad I ignored them. This film is pure escapism and a great way to spend a few hours
  My history with this film is not good. I believe I might have seen it first when I was a little too young. As a result I considered it kind of scary instead of fun. So then I just avoided watching it as I grew up. On the rare occasion that I watched it I just couldn't enjoy it. Recently my wife received Wizard of Oz on DVD, though, and insisted I give it another chance. I figured there was a chance I might have always prejudged it based on my first experience, so I gave it a shot. Sorry, but I just don't get it. Clearly this feels like a kids' movie but they include so many creepy elements from a wicked witch to flying monkeys. Frankly I even find the Munchkins a little unsettling. I'm not even sure they effectively explain the "lesson" that Dorothy learns at the end. Judy Garland acts like a five-year-old while looking like a twenty-year-old. On the positive side she definitely can sing. The songs are probably the biggest highlight of the film. I thought all the acting was just too melodramatic. This is why I'm convinced it's intended as a children's movie because there is zero subtlety to any of the performances. My favorite acting in the film all comes from Frank Morgan, who also adds 90% of the humor to the story. He plays 5 different characters better than most of the others play 1.Perhaps my biggest issue with this movie is how illogical it all seems. Glinda could send Dorothy home from the beginning but sends her on a pointless quest first? Glinda forces the ruby slippers on Dorothy's feet, creating the entire conflict between her and the wicked witch? The wizard sends a little girl to commit murder for him, for no particular reason? And none of that even mentions the worst part, because no resolution came in the Toto-vs-Gulch situation, so she'll just come back and have him put to sleep as before. So the primary conflict is never resolved. Dorothy wasn't running away because she didn't appreciate home, she was running away to save her pet. Yeah, so I give up. This clearly is not a film that is for me, and I'd be fine never watching it again, but I'll still listen to the soundtrack for some of those good songs.
  Woody Allen is a genius and this film is one of his best. I was expecting the usual Allen comedy but became so engrossed in the lives of these ordinary people and the choices they made in their lives. Very Tennessee Williams. I really liked it.
  Horrible. Walked out it was so bad. Although there were a few laughs, the movie is just over the top "trying" to be funny. Failed miserably
  Awesome... just wish there was more. And Max's character should have had more lines.
  4 out of 5 stars! This was a very good and powerful film! I can see why it won best film at the Oscars last year. Good acting, good writing, good cinematographer, and important messages conveyed throughout.
  For many movies, the viewing environment can drastically affect your perspective and ultimate assessment of your enjoyment of the film. When I was just about to become a teenager, I used to take the subway into Manhattan to go to several of the myriads of low-cost theaters located within a few blocks. This tendency for solitary viewing has carried over through my life long attachment for the cinema. Now, when I receive a new movie to preview my first exposure is during a quiet evening accompanied by only a pad and pen to jot down a few notes. There is an understandable exception to this sweeping generation, and the latest flick on the docket required hanging out with my best friend to create an atmosphere most conducive to the best way to fairly consider my impression of the movie. The film submitted for consideration was 'King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword.' Cutting directly to the chase the ensuing two hours and six minutes became the home version of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Unfortunately, our comments and jocular observations being a better source of entertainment than the actual movie. Ultimately, my final ranking came across slightly elevated than if I had followed my usual practice of a solitary viewing. Throughout the history of film, the Arthurian legend of brave knights, Camelot and striving for a better way to rule. There have been treatments of this story have been done from the perspective of the youthful exuberance leading to the round table, the weary older versions of the principle cast during the decline of dream and even a Broadway musical that was a hit on both stage and screen. Most of the standard plot devices and archetypes regarded as necessary for a successful project are ingrained in the foundation of this story including romance, combat, magic and one of the oldest of all themes, sibling rivalry. It requires the participation of many in the cast and crew to achieve this dubious goal but this movie is the epitome, or perhaps better stated as the nadir if anti-synergism were the total work is less than the sum of its parts.It is an excepted directorial style to bring the audience into the middle of the story, in medias res. It is considered an advanced technique requiring a considerable amount of expertise, experience, and talent. In this movie the director, Guy Ritchie is a name that is highly recognizable with a substantial fan base. However, this does not confer the proper bona fides on the auteur that would have permitted him to navigate the intricacies required successfully. His forte is predominantly brute force urban violence typically in London or another UK metropolitan area. The cockney accents are so realistically thought that English subtitles are typically necessary. This story set in the barbaric era of sub-Roman Britain circa early in the twelfth century. The dialogue is nearly indecipherable in what I have dubbed 'Middle Cockney.' To the detriment of any in the audience with real intentions of following a storyline, no subtitles were provided. When combined with an almost complete lack of any explanation, exposition or context. The version I was provided was in 3D, so I was hopeful of at least some noteworthy cinematography and imagery. This optimistic anticipation was depressed some when I noticed the Director of Photography was listed as Daniel Pemberton, a man whose work in movies was nearly entirely devoted to musical composition.The initial battle is led by the good king of Britain, Uther Pendragon (Eric Bana). His opponent in this mortal combat is the evil wizard, Mordred. Clad in the standardized fantasy rendition of ancient armor it looks as if the producers managed to pick up the metallic costume at Peter Jackson's post-Lord of the Rings yard sale. The battle is to determine the fate of humanity through the magical power of practitioners known as Mages. The king is victorious but is soon betrayed and murdered by his brother Vortigern (Jude Law), who usurps the throne. In the confusion of the coup, the royal prince and true heir to the throne are spirited away. In the darkest part of Londinium he his brought to a brothel raised by the prostitutes that name him Arthur. His childhood is mostly running cons on the street frequently rewarded by the men working in and near the house of ill repute. Arthur (eventually portrayed by Charlie Hunnam), diligently the by hordes the coins until by the time he reaches his majority he has accumulated a substantial chest of gold. His experiences provide him with street smarts, ingenuity, quick reflexes, strength, and stamina. The turning point of the story, or at least what is intended to pass as a story, is when a group of Vikings led by Greybeard (Mikael Persbrandt), mistreats one of the young ladies Arthur and his friends Tristan (Kingsley Ben-Adir) and Backpack (Neil Maskell). They are subdued and captured by the 'Blacklegs,' Vortigern's minions a general jackboot henchmen. The three are captured, added to a contingent of prospective slaves. As part of the induction process Arthur is placed in line with hundreds of other young men. The routine is to attempt to pull a magic sword from an enchanted stone. Everyone tries an fails moving on to the next station where they are branded as property. Arthur is anxious for his turn, pushing to the head of the line. Grabbing the hilt, it begins to move, and in a flood of visions, it comes free as Arthur passes out.Infused throughout the movie the dialogue, quickly becomes evident that there is no doubt that the man in the commanding chair is none other than Guy Ritchie. His directorial trademarks include intensely violent urban crime thrillers. As alluded to above his penchant for exceptionally thick Cockney accents makes following the dialogue nearly impossible except for the men and women occupying the areas I London represents the Vox popular, my jocular reference that the characters here spoke 'middle Cockney' was intended as descriptive more than satiric. Supplanting the requisite chase scene through the narrow back alleys and streets of London are replaced by the same hyperkinetic mayhem transposed chronologically to Londinium, a settlement preceding the modern city. The choice of location does permit the realization of a famous nursery rhyme line 'London bridge is falling' albeit resulting from a conflagration. If it wasn't for the conspicuous period costumes, the movie could very well be any of Mr. Ritchie's other offerings. This filmmaker is deservedly well considered within his genre of expertise, but he is out of his element helming a fantasy/supernatural action flick such as this.The overutilization of modern tropes, techniques and plot contrivances admittedly project a certain campy quality but barely sufficient to support the majority of the story. The inclusion of archetypes typically associated with modern times is so out of place in this setting that the overall effect is disconcertingly out of place. One of the most glaring examples is an attack on the royal pretender, Vortigern. The plot involved an archer in assassinating the king at an impossible distance. The sniper was played by an actor who has recently become synonymous with treacherous, covert plots, Aidan Gillen. In this story he plays archer extraordinaire, Sir William "Goosefat Bill" Wilson. He is highly recognizable as the Machiavellian most of Westeros, Lord Petyr "Littlefinger" Baelish. No matter what remarks may be applied to this movie it has an incredible cast with highly talented and seasoned performers in every role. This initiated a chase through the busy streets cluttered with tradespeople and surfs. The Blackleg soldiers brutally mow down anyone getting in their ways prompting my friend to note "#surf lives matter". This is such a typical scene for any film by Mr. Ritchie that his storyboards could have been from any of his flicks.The reliance on the supernatural that had been made indispensable to achieve the dénouement is so far out of the filmmaker's comfort zone that it comes across as little more than bad swords and sorcery made for TV movie. The actors are professionals doing their best to give their fans a commendable performance, but it is a decidedly an uphill battle neigh on impossible to overcome. Within the last few scenes of the story, there are a considerable number of loose ends and traditional aspects of the Arthurian legend that the best friends of now King Arthur are duly knighted, and a large round table is uncovered. It appeared that the studio demand the production completed, the conclusion left things open for a sequel but considering the estimated budget of $175,000,000 resulting in a domestic box office gross of just over $40 million. We may be spared the second act. The 3D effects are about average for an action film with a few ingenious effects to spice up an otherwise by the numbers production.
  I really don't get all of the bad reviews for this movie. I had such a good laugh the whole time. It's not a serious movie, it's a fun movie and to that end, you really do have fun. They don't take themselves too seriously and neither should we. Highly recommended for a good laugh at the end of a day when you don't need anymore serious stuff to think about.
  Best Movie of the Year....for real...
  A rare film that knows exactly what it is, doesn't needlessly reach for something deeper and has a surprising amount of character. The most focused and entertaining action movie I've seen in a long time.
  55%Saw this on 5/7/15Good, but extremely overrated. George Miller makes a great action movie, but kills the Mad Max character by giving him too little screen time. Mel Gibson was a better Mad Max. For better and worse, Charlize Theron's Furiosa always overshadows Mad Max. It's not Tom Hardy's fault, he just didn't have much to do here. Theron steals the show and Nicholas Hault is the second best character here. The film simply recreates a Road Warrior kind of Mad Max movie but with barely minimal plotting. For a film of $150 Million budget, Fury Road looks really cheap, although it has got some good action sequences here and there. The gun blazing wives are just a bunch of good looking chicks. The villain is extremely bad and is not even threatening. Mr Miller has directed the movie very well. I wish that they at least give Mad Max something to do in the possible sequels to this film.
  It was a fun movie. Not too challenging and interesting enough to keep me watching.
  Worst movie I? have seen in a while. I??be watched cheap porn that was better. Horrible language (even used in church setting)
  The medieval ages of mystics, and mages, and magic. Diving deep into the surreal and paranormal, which I usually despise in movies, is brought out to fight evil for once. Merlin and Arthur 2 of the most powerful men in English folklore history. Predictable, maybe, but when done with eloquence and colorful tapestry it is much more than tolerable.No spoilers here. Jude Law (king Vortigern) is always brilliant. Eric Bana (Uther) is a powerful albeit minor supporting actor. The CGI is used for amazing scenes that move the plot along with fervor. The tale is told with enough refreshing twists that make it unique, yet more believable and exciting than other remakes (anyone remember Robinhood king of theives?).Â I will never understand the Trolls who put the negative reviews on such masterpieces like this King Arthur movie. I am glad I read a lot of the great reviews by those who appreciated thus movie on Redbox than the ignoramuses who tried to skewer a well written and directed movie.When a movie transports your mind, heart, and soul to a time and you really feel like you are there then it has accomplished the directors every dream. I stopped watching Game if Thrones because they are more focused on nudity, violence, and profanity then the storytelling. How refreshing it is to have a meaningful dialogue and still embrace the beauty of goodwilled ladies and children. The might and Chivalry that comes to mind whoever I think of Camelot.Â Sean Connery has to be impressed. Errol Flynn would have been impressed with the accomplishments that reminisce those of Robin Hood and his merry men and Sherwood Forest. One of my favorite movies of all time. The comparison itself places this on an equal plane. I would go as far as putting it with Lord of The Rings (blasphemous?)Â Major props to the lead actor Charlie Humnam who plays Arthur, Djimon Hounsou (Bedivere), and Aiden Gillen (Bill). Special shout out to Neil Baskel (Back Lack) who I love in in PBS show humans, Astrid BergÃ¨s-Frisbey (mage). Perfect casting by Reg Poerscout-Edgerton (Guardians of the Galaxy, Dr Strange to name a couple others). Even David Beckham (yes the soccer player) was cast well.Finally I am newest Guy Ritchey fan. The choreography of all scenes was infinitesimal. He wrote and Directed "Legend if the Sword." The musical score (too many to mention) is to enhance a movie not dominate it (see Dunkirk). The Set directing, Costume design, sound editing, movie editor...all superb.The so-called critics really missed the mark on this one!!! I guess the 146.2 million USD box office tells the true story.Disclaimer...King Arthur and Excaliber have always been a secret fantasy of mine. Hopefully Guenevere will be in part II.
  A little cliched and a little odd with so many western actors. But Iooks good and I like these kinds of films.
  An impressive and exciting sci fi action movie!
  If you like Guy Ritchie movies you'll like this
  Watch this this weekend, on HBO, if you like Guy Ritchie films, watch this and if you like it, rate it at Rotten Tomato and IMDB
  This movie was very boring and stale When watching it all I could think about is how much better every movie I've even seen was this was the second worst movie I've even seen besides "The shallows" Daddy's Home 2 is a better watch if your lookin for a good night at the movies
  Excellent. Must see. Well Deserving of all the praise.
  To see "The Wizardof Oz" on an IMAX 3D is just... dazzling.
  Good direction of the characters and history, as well as giving them depth.However, I do not see the masterpiece of which it is spoken.
  Here is the thing about adaptations; they are not always good. There are two things that can go wrong when a director decides to do one. One, the original message gets interpreted wrong; and two, it gets so perverted that the original message doesn't get relayed properly. The live action adaptation of Ghost in the Shell has the latter of the two problems. The end of the movie, in words; says what I believe the original message of the animated movie was all about. The story they went with, the characters, and the overall feel of the movie does not convey this at all. It is not who we are, or our physical traits or nationality or even our gender what make us human, it is our soul; or in this case our ghosts; and our experiences is what defines us and makes us human. That's what the movie tells you in words. But what I got from it is who you were biologically is what makes us human. That is totally off the mark to me what the animated movie was all about. The point of the animated movie was that no matter how mechanized we become as humans, we are still humans because our souls remain with us, even if that line gets blurred in the process. In a perfect world; I could look at this movie and say "You know, the adaptation doesn't always have to remain faithful to the source material. The director can put their own spin on what they believe the source material was going for in order to make it their own." But realistically, I look at this movie; and I can't help but feel disappointed. An adaptation doesn't have to follow the source material one hundred percent, and therein lies the problem with adaptations. The Webster definition of an adaptation is a composition rewritten into a new form; a screen adaptation of a novel. Now what does that mean? It means you take that written or video work; and you can adapt it in order to make it your own without outright copying the work; or trying to claim it as your own. That would be plagiarizing, and that's bad. While the movie is a good adaptation by definition; in reality it is terrible. It is terrible because this movie already exists. The animated movie was done better, and the message of the work was portrayed better; and it really made you think. All this movie did was make me think I wasted my time watching this terrible movie. If you are going to make a live action adaptation of an animated work, you need to make it better than the original, or add something that further enhances the message. For anyone who hasn't seen the animated movie; it is about a Section 9 operative named Major Kusanagi (everyone just calls her Major). Her job is to fight cyber terrorism. Now because this universe takes place in a world where a majority of the population has a lot of cybernetic enhancements, and androids are a very real thing; that definition extends to a lot of things. Like human brains being hacked as an example. A crime happens where an ambassador of some kind is having tea at a robot geisha house. He gets attacked and... oh wait; I confused the start of the animated movie with the animated series, and apparently so did the director. I also want to point out that the animated series (Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex) is different enough from the animated movie that it can be considered its own thing. Not only does it explain the universe of Ghost in the Shell a lot better than the movie does; it also gives bits of backstory of who the Major is. So what the live action movie does is pick and choose scenes and events from both the animated movie and the animated series; and mashes it together to make a movie, but it doesn't do that well either. The Major is also apparently some Asian girl who was taken and made into a cyborg without consent by some big evil mega corporation named Hanka Corp or whatever. Doesn't really matter because the plot is adapted as poorly as the movie was. In the animated movie, Section 9 is trying to find and capture a hacker named The Puppet Master. But you find out the hacker is actually a sentient AI made by Section 6, and they are trying to cover it up because somehow the AI escaped and is trying to survive. It also has the hots for the Major because it wants to meld their ghosts together to make something even better than human. Along the way they explore themes of human existence, and what it means to be human, are you still human if you copy all your memories as data and copy it to a cybernetic brain. The live action movie treats completely cybernetics humans like the Major as a rare thing, but in the animated movie it is pretty common, and a fully biological human with no enhancements is super rare; hence "what is humanity" is such a strong thing to ask in a world where cybernetic enhancements is commonplace. The plot of the live action movie is The Major gets turned into a cyborg but has a human brain, and this is the start of them doing this. An employee of the company gets attacked and hacked because the aforementioned AI from the animated movie is trying to get information on all the employees involved in the project that involve The Major being created. But you find out he's not an AI but a failed version of the Major and he's trying to kill everyone involved in the project for revenge and blah blah blah. I feel like this plot mostly consists of getting all of the really amazing cinematography from both the animated series and the animated movie and making them look really amazing in live action. They do that pretty well, and the fighting scenes are pretty good as well. If this were a standalone movie it would actually be pretty good; but it can't be because it is being compared with the animated movie, and that is far superior. Her name in the movie and the animated series is Motoko Kusanagi, which is good but it just feels wrong because The Major on the animated movie knows who and what she is and is a total bad-ass. In this Scarlett Johansson does a really good job at being a bad-ass; and does her best with what she's got, but the character feels like she is written like a kid trying to get use to her new body. At one point she finds a human and is like "oh so this is what a human feels like". What?! No that's just stupid; but because they wrote her as having fake memories with a tragic backstory to motivate her, this could be seen as normal to her. The rest of the characters are OK. I could have gotten used to how Batou looked in this. But then they gave him his robot eyes and he just looks so stupid! What the hell guys, like it would have probably look better if they were bigger and more in his head like in the animated movie, but in this he just looks creepy and weird!! I came into this with an open mind, but I just couldn't take it by the end of it. They do such a horrible job with the plot and how they just insert different scenes from both the series and the animated movie; that at one point the movie became painful to watch. If you are curious to watch this movie just to see how they manage to ruin yet another adaptation to an animated property; then by all means watch this movie. But be warned, this movie will infuriate you. Or you'll just laugh the whole time. Hopefully you get that reaction from this; I certainly wish I had.
  As a fan of the original anime I came into this film hoping that the film makers would capture the same wonder the animated version had for me as a teen. While the film isn't completely devoid of the intelligence and sleek story telling of it's Japanese counterpart it is missing that certain something and ultimately doesn't quite give off the same feeling. If you've never seen the original than perhaps this film might hold something for you but if you're a fan of it then it might be better if you skip the live action version.
  Definitely the 2nd best movie of 1939! A classic for all-time!
  What a let down. Shanghai finance.
  I enjoyed the film far more than I expected. Funny, cute and heartwarming.
  Una de las mejores películas de acción que he visto últimamente. Perfectamente filmada, es un espectáculo visual excesivo, intenso, épico. Tom Hardy increíble donde todo lo da con el rostro y que decir de Charlize Theron y su maravillosa furiosa. Espectacular.
  Great movie and effect are pretty amazing.One of my favorite movies. Highly recommend it
  Ah, nostalgia. The Wizard of Oz shook Hollyood, and 70 plus years later still holds a special place in so many hearts. The songs and sets still dazzle, and Dorothy's journey still warms the heart.
  I want to see if it's that bad.
  Well shot, but overrated. I don't mind a human story but nothing barely happens here.
  It's not one of those action packed movies that I like, but one of those movie that the title don't catch your eye but it got awards in the oscars so I decided to check it out and it actually came out pretty interesting to see, ending sucked though.
  Awesome, gritty, spectacular, wonderfully acted and a fantastic engaging story. Definitely One of the best action films ever made!!!
  Peter Jackson's scale and Snyder's wet dream, Ritchie succeeds in dosing King Arthur with ecstasy and it's never been better. A rather strange combination of Ritchie's style/aesthetic with such a specific and confined lore sounded somewhat troubling, yet both compliment each other rather well. Ritchie's storytelling and edit work well within the story as does the lead Hunham, who is edging closer to being more and more comfortable in film. Law plays an equally as impressive villain in true over the top fashion. However, the over indulgence and reliance on CGI does tarnish what could've easily have been pratical effects
  I felt like I was watching a film specifically made to win an Oscar. All the social criteria are there. It is actually a very boring film with a very predicable story line.
  In no way did this deserve the Oscar for best picture or supporting actor! Very well made and excellent score but not Oscar worthy
  Loved it, great fun!
  This is a good movie for small kids who enjoy science. It gives elements of engineering, biology, chemistry, archeology, and environmental preservation. It starts off a bit slow and doesn't build the characters so well, but it had my nephew and the other kids in the theater cheering. Their happiness is what counts the most.
  George Miller makes a triumphant return with this hardcore non-stop thrill-ride. Fans of the original Mad Max films will be filled with glee, while newcomers will also be won over. Hardy has an amazingly demanding presence as the iconic role, sometimes by not even speaking. And Theron plays the most badass heroine in any film of recent memory. The unique cinematography is a pleasure to watch, and its practical-effects for every action-sequence are jaw-dropping. The amazing stunts and successfully conveyed themes of feminism, religion, and tyranny, make it one of the greatest action films in the passed 20 years.
  In short this is NOT Ghost in the shell, I watch all Ghost in the shell anime and comics, this movie make me keep laughing from the beginning to the end, Not evening worth your time if you a true Ghost in the shell fans.
  That movie was awesome cannot believe how it turns out if you could give it a eight stars. I would.
  I signed up just to see if it was possible to rate a movie with just the barest tip of one star. Stuck with 1/2. This movie represents the upcoming death of Western Civilization. Thanks for this loser of a sign post Ritchie.
  Yet another movie mad to sell happy meal toys. Same tired theme good guy reluctant hero is almost beaten befor he calmly overcomes impossible odds. The action is for kindergarteners and the entire thing is outlandish in a power rangers kind of way. It reduces legend to unbeleavability in the same fashion as Noah. Did I mention it's just plain corney? Almost like it was directed by the boyfriend of some crazy singer.
  I read this review and it says it all, When McDonald's tries to make Sushi .
  boring boring boring. another movie you have to say how in the world did it win an Oscar.
  I thought it was cute! For full disclosure, I have not yet seen the first movie, but I went to this movie looking for light-hearted, fun holiday-themed entertainment, and I found it. It's neither a "deep" movie nor high drama, but it is not intended to be either of those things. It's both fun and funny, and the casting is excellent. In particular, Christine Baranski really shines in her role as an over-the-top perfectionist mother.
  I hate that Rotten Tomatoes ruined any chance of sequel for this movie. If you like Guy Ritchie films, you will love this movie. His style of directing and camera angles are among some of my favorites, he used some techniques from Sherlock Holmes, but gave it a different twist, and it's amazing! I love the story, it is of course not 100% with the original story, but it's a good one. It hits all the main topics, and Ritchie adds in his own flavor. I love Charlie Hunnam, and it sucks that he hasn't had good luck with movies, because I think he's a great actor, and it's a shame that this stupid website ruined the chances of this, because a sequel could have been EPIC!! Stupid Rotten Tomatoes. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!! You won't be disappointed, and if you are, you probably don't like Guy Ritchie, Charlie Hunnam, or not big on sword fighting.
  With the blend of practical and CGI effects, beautiful cinematography and jaw dropping action, Mad Max: Fury Road is a welcome addition to the MAD MAX anthology
  Crap! Absolute crap!
  I speak for the general public when I say that this movie is absolutely amazing. Guy Richie has outdone himself!
  This was very a very new experience for me in terms of movies and topics. I wasn't expecting what happened, to happen in the movie. Great movie though.
  For adults, a fresh retake on a glorious movie. For a new generation, a glimpse at an exceptional movie before all the CGI "stuff" !
  A charming and loving throwback to the kids movies of the 80's that didn't needlessly pander to their audience. Although the boy-and-his-beast framework formula has been done to deat, the actual concept is fresh and fun.
  I have never wanted a movie to not end so badly in my entire life.
  This is the worst movie I have ever seen.
  not much really happens and not very groundbreaking. hugely overrated but still better than La La Land.
  Fantastically directed and beautifully shot with a striking use of colour and music, 'Moonlight' is one of those rare films that captures the essence of something special, relating its tale in a way that casts a spell on its audience. Following the life of someone who is seen to be a little different, we see him go from a boy to a man and how his experiences, the good and the bad, have shaped him. Outstanding performances from all involved rounds things off, making this an incredibly engaging film in more ways than one, giving us an insight into the lives of those who are not often seen on the silver screen.
  I used to watch this movie a lot as a child. I have lost count on how many times I have seen it.
  A cracking showdown of a post-apocalyptic premise and outstanding visuals wrapped with fun-fest of mayhem and absurdity.While at the same time showing lack of depth in the plot & few loose ends in the storyline.Nonetheless, it's uniqueness will amaze you & will take you to a different world. All in on, Mad Max: Fury Road is one hell of a ride.
  Good comedy; has lots of Cussing and inappropriate kid scenes, but is great for Adults!
  better than I thought it would be
  Best chase movie ever made it's up there
  The Wizard Of Oz is a movie that everyone should see and is still a marvel 75 years later.
  very few funny parts
  Moonlight is arguably one of the best films of the year that has a plot that is told by visuals even if the ending can be at first confusing. 100%
  There are some films you just don't like without being able to give a precise reason. This is one of them.
  Thought it would be funnier. Great comedic actors with a bad script. Was waaaay to serious at he end
  I just love this movie. The action set pieces blew me away even before I found it that it was made with mostly practical effects. Tom Hardy can do no wrong and Charlize Theron is an outstanding lead female essentially making the film her own.
  Seems that Guy Ritchie is the go-to director to give old-fashioned properties a (questionably) needed English gangster aesthetic-an aesthetic that made himself a household name with 1998s Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and 2000s Snatch. After successfully pulling this trick off with 2009s Sherlock Holmes (and the 2011 sequel) and the underrated 2015 espionage action-comedy The Man From U.N.C.L.E. (best not talk about his Madonna-starring remake of 2002s Swept Away), the British director has now implemented his quick-cut, fast-talking style into a property that is dear to his homeland with 2017s King Author: Legend of the Sword, a film that has way too much going on but is ultimately a satisfying, fun, experience non-the-less. Much credit should be given to Ritchie for not only doing something completely different with material that would (most likely) be done exactly how one would assume if another filmmaker were at the helm but still make a story so old feel new, unique and revitalized. With a screenplay that gets the best out of Ritchie's kinetic way of storytelling (written by Lionel Wigram, Joby Harold and Ritchie), the pace of the film is unrelenting with a ton of information thrown at you but the engagement level never deters even when giant bats, giant elephants and giant snakes spill over the frames. With a huge dose of weird (Ritchie indulges in visual extravagance one wouldn't expect from the filmmaker), a huge dose of momentum (this film never lets up-with a great score from John Mathieson to keep things ticking) and a huge dose of (escapist) entertainment, King Author: Legend of the Sword is a worthy retelling of such an old tale, proving Ritchie's inspired, singular pedigree with updating older properties.
  So bad compared to the first. I was really looking forward to this movie and felt so disappointed.
  Fury Road had one of the best trailers in the cinematic history, and to my surprise it exceeds that ridiculously high expectation. Total exhilaration and pure visual awe for two hours, with relatively little stands in the way of the continuous castle siege on wheels.Story is simple enough, although I wouldn't mind the film adds another 20 mins for extra character and the dystopia developments.Nonetheless, what a crazy good time at the cinema. It left me trying to catch my breath and every recent action flicks in the dust. Frankly, I feel bad for any film lovers that somehow managed to miss it.
  Exciting film if you have never watched the original or don't have an interest in Anime. The film does a good job at re-enacting some scenes from the original but overall a very western interpretation of the original. I felt Japanese was just thrown into the film to remind us it was an anime.
  It's a cute little movie! I really enjoyed it. My 4 year old was a little bored because the story was so good and for him but that's why I liked it. It taught that monsters are sweet animals.
  Groundbreaking in every single way. From its visuals, songs, to it's storytelling and touching heartfelt message. The Wizard Of Oz is a must see for all ages even if you didn't grow up with it it's still an iconic piece of filmmaking
  Excellent!! Loved it,If you like excitement this is it!
  I know several people who really dislike this movie, I'm guessing because it was hyped and lauded so much when it's a pretty dumb action flick. I went in thinking it was going to be another crappy reboot/remake/sequel and came out really surprised. Then I thought about it for awhile and went to see it twice more. It is a great action movie, a great exploitation/grindhouse film, and (I think) a modern classic. I don't like Tom Hardy, and I think he's great in the role of Max because he hardly talks. With the exception of the STUPID made-for-3D shot near the end (you know which one), this is one of the most fun films I've seen come out in years. Obviously, don't be expecting Lawrence of Arabia, here.
  Watched it at least 8 times and I can't get enough. Movie is epic!
  It's a classic and the top-rated film. There is no question.
  It's very true to the original. And it's very deep and well-orchestrated - the music, the video sequences... It's really good. I don't trust critics anymore...
  Didnt like this movie, to many things not explained...... Dont see the reason for all the hype...... Seems like its just pushin the agenda......
  Moonlight felt like a very personal film made with an abundance of care and attention for every detail. The acting is great all around, at parts it's actually quite superb, and the casting I have to say was spot on. With a great soundtrack and a very emotionally touching score I really enjoyed Moonlight. It felt like something different and unique. Since it's a character driven film I found that while Barry Jenkins' directing and the film's cinematography is gorgeous to look at and the script and dialogue feels very authentic, I did not get to know Chiron's character that much during the film, and that definitely took away a lot from his personality and some of the enjoyability for me. This made it a lot harder for me to resonate with Chiron. It seemed to me that Moonlight's focus was at times a bit too much on showcasing the main characters struggles and the supporting characters, while not enough on actually building up an interesting personality for him.
  My 2nd IMAX 3d film and it was wonderful. Good acting and a great classic for anyone at any age. Good musical numbers and effects.
  It was pretty to look at but the film as a whole was hollow. It only paid lip service to scenes from the anime and manga, plus I can't really say I cared that much for the characters. It wasn't terrible and its certainly better than attempts like Dragonball Evolution and Aeon Flux, but it could have been deeper and more intricate than it ended up being. If you know nothing about Ghost in the Shell you will probably like it as the story ultimately boils down to RoboCop.
  The best classic film in history.
  One of my favorite movies of all time and quite possibly my favorite action movie of all time!! I could watch this over and over again.
  a classic hollywood film that delights not just kids, but the older generations as well. I am amazed that the picture holds up so well after 80 years, and say it came out in like the 50's, well then i wouldn't be quite as amazed. This one certainly deserves a perfect rating. Why did that one guy have to ruin it.
  Radically well Shot, acted, edited and just downright fun to watch
  Some extremely funny parts in this movie. Other parts seemed like they were trying to fill time to be a full-length movie - they could have been funnier or left out. Also, it tried to be deep and emotional, which wasn't needed. A very funny movie about mom's at Christmas would have been just fine. Overall, I would RECOMMEND,
  This movie captivated me every time I see it and I've watched it several times on HBO now. I wish so much for a prequel with utter pendragon and Merlin. The music definitely captivates and sinks me further into the story. Badass.
  I AM FAN OF GUY RITCHIE AND THIS FILE WAS GOOD. I HOPE TO SEE A BETTER SEQUEL
  I wasn't expecting much but it had me laughing out loud.
  Just watched the blu ray release of this wonderful masterpiece and it's a real eye opener when we see films these days spending massive budgets unnecessarily and this is a great example of how you can make a great film on a smaller budget. The actors and actresses are brilliant and so are the sets. This is one of those movies everyone must see. The story flows well and it will keep you hooked.
  The movie starts out interestingly enough but as in most movies made buy directors with an unlimited budget, they lack the ability to end the movie with finesse and logic. The ending is a smothering of special effects that are all over the place and make no sense. This will work well for a 5 year old audience with limited cognitive abilities. Why tell a story then end the story with whatever pops in your mind. Were the producers on ecstasy and molly when they were writing the screenplay? Probably. Re-write the ending and make it a little more along the story line of King Arthur and it wouldn't be such a overcooked mess of dung. Give me the reins (a complete amateur) next time so it will make sense and be memorable. I promise not to trip on acid when I'm writing the ending. Holy Sh#+!
  "There's no place like home." Do I even need to say anymore? This classic film is iconic in every way and a family favorite in nearly every household. PLOT:Young Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland) is a farm girl living in the grey plains of Kansas with her Aunt Em (Clara Blandick) and Uncle Henry (Charles Grapewin). Even though she's a young girl, she dreams big of traveling the lands before her. However, a tornado comes along and sweeps her house up with her and Toto, her little dog, inside. The house comes down in the town of Munchkinland in the wonderful land of Oz. To find her way back home, she has to find the wizard in the Emerald City while avoiding the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton), who's out to get her for dropping a house on her sister. On the way, she meets a Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), a Tin Woodsman (Jack Haley), and a Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr), who choose to accompany her on her journey to see the wizard, wanting a brain, a heart, and courage in return. It's a great plot executed brilliantly. ACTING:The performances in here were really good. Judy Garland played an innocent and iconic role as the young farm girl, Dorothy. Playing well off her and each other, Jack Haley, Ray Bolger, and Bert Lahr performed excellent, iconic roles as the Scarecrow, Tin Woodsman, and Cowardly Lion. I favored Bert Lahr out of the trio, for his performance doubled comedically as it did iconically. Margaret Hamilton also played a great part as the Wicked Witch of the West. She still seems menacing today. The other shiners would be Clara Blandick as Aunt Em, Charles Grapewin as Uncle Henry, Billie Burke as Glinda the Good Witch, Frank Morgan as The Wizard of Oz, and all of the munchkins. There really wasn't a bad performance in here. SCORE:The musical score and soundtrack for this film are iconic, memorable, and catchy to sing as well as to hear. Everybody knows a song from it, whether it's "We're Off to See the Wizard", "Ding-Dong the Witch is Dead", or even "If I Only Had a Brain." Everybody knows the catchy soundtrack to this film. EFFECTS:The effects were astounding back in their time and are still very colorful today. The best effect at the time would have to have been the dramatic and iconic change from sepia/grayscale to Technicolor. That was a dazzling change for people back then and is still a prominent mark in film history. The prop effects were pretty colorful, and the more digital effects (such as the fireballs and the bubbles) were pretty interesting. The effects overall back then were pretty top-notch, but they still stand as interesting to watch now. OTHER CONTENT:This film is iconic on so many levels. Everybody has either seen or heard of the Wizard of Oz, and it's a family favorite for the young children and the older adults. Comparing it to the original book, the film seems to be based only loosely on it. However, this film adaptation improved it from its book form. Everything about this film is really perfect for its time and loveable even today. OVERALL,an epic film with a brilliant plot, really good performances, catchy score and soundtrack, colorful effects, and an iconic legacy left for filmgoers everywhere.
  THE "absolute masterpiece".
  The film's visuals are where everything works at it's best, but it's lack of focus on the writing, it's indifference to narrative structure and it's unavoidable casting issues make this something that's harder to watch than it should be. It's no shock to me that this film bombed financially and critically, it's an absolute shock to me that they could screw it up this much.
  The Movie has a certain trashy vibe to it that makes it watchable, but nothing more.
  Loved how the film was shot. Very creative.
  A movie about life, growing up, but above all, defining yourself. It revolves around what Juan says : "At some point, you gotta decide for yourself who you're going to be. Can't let nobody make that decision for you."
  Critics are dumb. This movie is phenomenally entertaining.
  This was so intense! I was amazed at the things that I noticed which I could never see before! Highly recommend for all Oz fans!
  The best movie ever made my favorite sense I first saw it
  Thought it was alright. Never saw the original to compare. Started really cool, but ended with a dud in my opinion.
  Visually stunning, grande and so over the top it's great.
  It was ok, but I liked the first one better.
  Un capolavoro senza tempo, Mad Max: Fury Road è un film incredibile, sensazionale e travolgente. George Miller torna dopo tutti questi anni e ci propone un'opera esagerata, che sbaraglia completamente qualsiasi forma di concorrenza, sia del 2015 che, oserei dire, di tutto il decennio. Non serve essere fan della trilogia originale, e quasi non serve averla vista. Chiunque si accorgerebbe della perfetta esecuzione delle scene d'azione sotto tutti gli aspetti tecnici. Non servirebbe neanche elencare tutti i pregi della pellicola, ma mi vorrei soffermare sul montaggio. E' senza dubbio il miglior montaggio che io abbia mai visto: conferisce un ritmo serrato e frenetico al tutto, unendo le scene con una precisione maniacale. Sapere che il lunghissimo lavoro è stato fatto da una singola donna, la moglie del regista tra l'altro, rende la cosa ancora più eroica. Oltre a questo è da sottolineare il perfetto lavoro che si è svolto sul comparto sonoro, sia per quanto riguarda la colonna sonora, che per il montaggio sonoro dei rumori. Quest'ultimo aspetto rende il film un'opera unica, che va gustata anche con le orecchie e non solo con gli occhi. La storia è funzionale all'azione e all'intrattenimento, offre qualche situazione apprezzabile, anche se chi non conosce tutto l'universo di Mad Max potrebbe riscontrare qualche difficoltà a collegare alcuni pezzi del puzzle. Nel complesso si tratta di un'opera magistrale, che dimostra a gran voce le infinite possibilità che si possono sfruttare con il cinema. E' uno dei miei film preferiti in assoluto, e senza dubbio tra i migliori film d'azione della storia.
  I love the sense of humor in this film
  Arthur Pendragon with a fohawk? Seriously?! If that's not ridiculous enough, Guy Ritchie's excessive styling is obnoxious and disorienting when applied to this already convoluted and poorly explained take on the classic fable.
  we found this flick thoroughly entertaining and well acted, although as many critics pointed out it isn't the "traditional" King Arthur tale.
  Excellent acting on all levels with the best special effects for the period.
  I did not love "Bad Moms", but there were some things to like about it. The movie is well cast and there were some very clever jokes scattered through out the movie (The best being the scene at the bar where Mila Kunis' character keeps saying the wrong thing to every man she meets.). However the same cannot be said for this terrible sequel. All of the jokes fall flat. I did not laugh once. The characters of the mothers are so intensely dislikeable it's no mystery at all why their daughters initially wanted nothing to do with them! The performances in the film are all way below par which is especially surprising given the amount of talent among the cast. Also it could not have been more obvious that at the last possible minute all would be forgiven and the respective families would be whole again. We have seen that in more sitcoms than it is possible to count. "Bad" is the perfect way to describe this movie. I wonder why the Golden Raspberry Awards Foundation overlooked this piece of garbage.
  Unlike Daddy's Home 2, this is not nearly as good as its predecessor. Still, it's mindless fun, especially for you moms out there.
  It very impresive how so little dialog can build such an impressive world, Despite of being a full action film in a chaotic post apocalyptic world, the movie is not chaotic at all, Miller was able to guide you through this world and tell an impresive viceral story which resembles more a myth than an action film.

  Painfully Average movie :/ why did I even watch it.Movie for kids I guess.
  beautiful and classic film
  Please consider never talking to me about movies if you dont like this movie. Classic
  Too me at least its not as bad as the critics make out. I found it entertaining. I was in the mood for an action flick with a fantasy feel and this fit the bill nicely. Its nicked bits from quite alot of other sword, fantasy films but hey it didn't bother me. I found the use of london accents amusing and enjoyed more of the movies scenes than i didn't enjoy. Looking forward to more.
  Forget the critics on this one. This was an amazing movie and it's a fun watch.
  Me encantó más allá de todo lo que cortaron del anime
  brilliantly classic! miss
  Gay stories are severely lacking in cinema and when gay characters do exist, they're rarely done justice, commonly portrayed as sidekicks or stereotypes. But Moonlight, by indie African American director Barry Jenkins, is an extraordinary coming of age drama that lays the struggles of one gay man front and centre, while asking difficult and open ended questions about the nature of masculinity and sexuality in African American culture, issues rarely explored on the big screen.The story, based on Tarell Alvin McCraney's play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue, chronicles the life of a young black man from childhood to adulthood as he struggles to find his place in the world growing up in 'da hood'. It is a heartbreaker of a film, incredibly moving and of staggering depth and subtlety, a coming of age drama both specific in its subject while universal in its theme.The narrative has a triptych structure. Across three moments in the life of its main character, Chiron (played by three different actors), it communicates how difficult it is if you are black and gay in a community in which masculinity is strictly defined and demanded.This story of an impoverished life of a young, gay black American is full of powerful performances from its cast. The style of the film demands that much is conveyed with no dialogue and its extraordinary performances meet the challenge.Trevante Rhodes and Mahershala Ali are both outstanding, and it's a stunning turn by André Holland. The film is also dazzling, visually intoxicating cinema, sensually and mesmerically shot. It has incredible flow moving easily between the desperate events without ever seeming merely episodic. A symphony in three acts, Moonlight is at once a vital portrait of contemporary African American life and an intensely personal and poetic mediation on gay identity, family, friendship and love. Moonlight is a sublime achievement and a groundbreaking piece of cinema. And a richly deserved awards winner.
  Great movie for everyone, not just kids! A classic.
  I remember watching this as a small child back in the late 1970s, again as nine year old in the early 1980s, and as a fourteen year old in the late 1980s. The first time, I think I liked it. The second time, I remember I had a bad dream that the Wicked Witch of the West was chasing after me on a broomstick. In the dream, I remember I threw a bucket of water on the Wicked Witch, and she melted away.By the time I got to my teens, I found this film reminded me of a shopping centre pantomime- cloying and patronizing, and I hated it. I still cannot bring myself to like The Wizard of Oz. Call me cold hearted if you will, but there are plenty of films from my childhood (anything starring The Muppets) that I still cherish today, and I would rather watch those instead of this.
  A thrilling and superbly shot film that conveys this bleak world quite perfectly.
  So.... GHOST IN THE SHELL, 2017 edition movie...One more expensive pile of shit from Hollywood !When i see this crap, i thanks everyday Katsuhiro Otomo for not having given his approval to make an Hollywood adaptation of Akira (adaptation that Hollywood exec invested in and wanted to do so badly, that it ended up being the somewhat descent "Chronicles").We went from a Shakespearian questioning about human soul and existence (original manga), to (in the 2017 edition) humans are obsolete, lets to go to 100% machine.Let's trash the questioning about soul, man doesn't have one.Memories ? useless !Humans history and roots ? Why bother !Moving on.In the original manga, a 100% Ai machine is questioning itself about the fact of having a ghost (soul), its existence, where it is fitting in the grand scheme of things.What is like to have memories as humans do ?What is the place of Human evolution and cyborgs on the Tree of Life (ToL shown in the original manga and symbolically destroyed by the puppet master...meaning, cybernetic is an artifact, a rupture in the evolution as in the context of the Tree Of Life)The cyborg was just a pretense to a age old questioning about human essence.In the 2017 edition, this is totally twisted. Here a former human is now a brain transplanted in a cybernetic body (like Robocop, but as you will see further, the approach is radically different. When Robocop still defines himself as an human through is emotions and memories, here we have a character that rejects booth... And we are told down the line that this is the ultimate wet tech dream, the future of humanity, rejoice puny humans, you are obsolete).This new creature rejects having memories, doesn't want to know where she comes from, never questioned having a ghost or she is not caring at all about it (As shown in the geisha deep dive scene)So, let's keep the brain because only the brain is the answer to human existence.Bye Bye the Soul, here we talk just about the Mind (which is an intellectual construct, hence keep the brain).Bye Bye the questioning about the meaning of having a Soul (the characters don't seem to have one anyway, so...) having a conscience, roots, origins.Bye Bye memories. Here memories, that where playing an essential roles in defining human existence in the original version, are stated to be trash and useless.And when the scientist played by Juliet Binoche states to the Major "you are what everyone will become one day", the tanshumanist scum / ultra materialistic agenda is clearly stated in all its glory.The basic premises of the 2017 version are in total opposition with the initial vision of Masamune Shirow (who was paid enough not to care, but i come back on that later on, not everybody have the integrity (nor the career) of Akira creator Katsuhiro Otomo).And the movie is a downright perverted transhumanist propaganda (that the original version, in despite of the appearances, was not)The director (whose name i didn't even bother to look for i must confess) have clearly no vision and purpose, and certainly forgot (if he ever knew), like the characters of his movie, that essence precedes form.It is really badly directed, and even not that appealing visually.I couldn't root for any characters (especially the main one) except maybe for Batou, who remains quite an interesting character (compared to the others...)And that it's when the characters are not down right ridiculous (Beat Takeshi character and interpretation is awefull, at least the other characters could have also talked with him in japanese instead of answering him in english, the sens of discontinuity and bad editing is reinforced here).Scarlett Joahnsoon, is never believable (but ok, i never thought that she was believable in any movies anyway...).One good thing however, she really looks like the manga version of Major Kusanagi, pretty damn close.as for the Puppet Master depiction... In the original manga he has a purpose, was the ultimate st graal of evolution for the main character.He was depicted as the quintessence of evolution, having transcended form/matier and becomes pure information, a omniscient soul that could take any forms, any bodies.In 2017, he is reduced to a pathetic cyborg with a human brain, that only sick revenge through the last human emotion he is able to feel and express...So basically the message is clear, humans are just like animals with no soul, just brains with a stomach, and the only possibility of evolution for them is to stay is the material world, but as a cyborg... Bye Bye transcendence...!The editing is bad, very bad. It always misses the mark anytime to bring some tensions, emotions and depth.Just when an alternative meaning could have been brought to the audience by the acting, or just the contemplating, CUT.Just a senseless succession of shoots with no interests, barely informational about the arc.A " I wannabe a tron soundtrack" score with no soul and emotion, that barely depicts/completes what is on screen.And i am not speaking about the fact that it is a millions years away from the multi layered original score of the manga that was mixing traditional and modern, and proposing an alternative reading to the reality presented to us on screen.It was allowing us to dive in the no verbal side of the main character's questioning about her existence and soul, adding a emotional counter part to the intellectual/conceptual talks.Now the music is just one dimensional, action oriented only, and quite annoying at times.The Director tried to insert some shoots/sequences from the original manga, but striped from their main essence, and with a "speed" up" edit.When the sage points the moon, the idiot stares at the finger... It is a fail every time.Senseless, meaningless.Now what Masamune Shirow had to say about the movie...I must confess i didn't follow all the interviews he has done.But in the ones I've seen, his answer is a typical Japanese way of saying (or not saying, as Japanese do) that it sucks but hey, "i am not going to spite in my soup..." !When asked about the movie, the only thing he had to say (as far i can recall) was that he was very happy with the look of the city with its holographic advertising, it was what he initially wanted to do but couldn't at the time...AND THAT IS IT !As for the overall looks / designs / cgi, not even the big shock i was expecting, but that is not the most important part when the storyline is good, the acting is good, the directing is good... You get the point !
  This is one hell of a ride, and I enjoyed every moment of it! A simple story with traditional stunts and effects, including memorable characters! George Miller is the badass director whom we love! Awesome job!
  One of the best movies...sadly it is underrated
  perfect scenes and very genuine interpretation of a life experience that I may never understand. Beautiful
  While today's kids may find this boring, film fans and the general audience alike will find this film full of heart and not without a brain. AND WHOEVER THAT ONE PERSON IS THAT MADE THIS 99%, GO SEE THE WIZARD AND DIE. :D
  A family friendly movie but if you're thinking about taking the bros out you might want to reconsider.
  When this was first announced, I was looking forward to seeing it. I love the anime` and I am a big fan of Scarlett Johansson. She deserves a much better movie than this abomination. The thing I liked the most about the anime` was that it got you to think. The only thing I thought about watching this was how long until I walked out (answer 45 min.). Another thing about the Anime` was the stark contrast between the high tech cybernetics and the filth and clutter of Hong Kong. GITS won an international animation award for ground breaking animation. In this movie, Hong Kong is just a bad rip off of Blade Runner and Fifth Element. In my opinion, the only way this movie could have been worse is if Michael Bay had directed it.
  too fragmented lacking connections so didn't know what happened to father figure/drug dealer in beginning...was he in jail, dead? Funeral referenced but he was mentioned later in present tense. Skip 10 yrs what happened after fight at school to living in Atlanta? Also, how did mom go from nurse to crack addict. Best pic should be near perfect or at least a best picture...which to me this was not. Ok at best. Gotta give it up for performances which were great.
  A Hollywood favorite for all the suspected reasons.Skip it Middle America
  It succeeds by being pretty much unique in its cool portrayal of a topic rarely treated this way, it has many tender moments of varying degrees, and is all beautifully filmed. However, it offers no glimmer of real hope or optimism, and utterly fails to address the betrayal so brutally thrown in front of us - as though making a hard life look good is enough. Almost every scene, on its own, is excellent, but the story they tell together is stereotyped and very problematic. And there's some very over done shaky-cam close-up footage.
  One of the best movies I've seen
  Go into it with an open mind and it's a great movie. Fun action with good acting and great cgi.
  loved how this story was directed. great actors! Very entertaining.
  I really enjoyed this movie. It was getting bad press months and months before it ever came out. With the cost of going to see a film that scares people off. Once again the critics opinion and mine was way off. It's to bad there won't be any sequels now because I, for one, would have seen them without question.
  I don't get the just of the story. And therefore I did not like it.
  All-time favorite movie!
  THE BEST MOVIE IN THE MOVIE HISTORY OF ALL TIME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  I just want Furiosa to be my fiance. #Iloveher
  The last time I went to see a monster in a truck was when I responded to an advert on Grinder by a dude named Bad Billy - this film was just as painful! If you're gonna use a monster instead of a truck engine, you shouldn't be surprised to see the cost of insurance premiums continue to rise...
  A beautiful piece of independent cinematographic art Moonlight is touching, though-provoking and extraordinary movie. A magnificent blend of acting, directing and camera-work, this is an intimate and personal story which works as a strikingly realistic essay on social, racial and sexual tensions in the post-modern US society. The story of young Afro-American Chiron and his struggle to find his place in society, to express and to accept his sexuality is told in three different stages of his life. Tensed and yet gentle, the story is disturbingly painful as it delves into the themes of race, sexuality and isolation. Still, every minute of Barry Jenkins' story is told in a delicate, beautifully crafted manner which also allow the cast to shine in their outstanding performances. Naomi Harris, Ashton Sanders (teen Chiron), Trevante Rhodes (adult Chiron) and of course Maherashala Ali stun with their on-screen presences. None of them truly shines on his own, but together as a team, with their restrained, but deeply emotional performances, they succeeds to provide the final element to Barry Jenkins' flawless movie: the acting. Acting as human beings, acting as people who are part of this story and not only people getting into specific characters. Speaking Maherashala Ali, especially after his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, it should be noted the impact which he has on the movie. Even with his limited participation, his embodiment of a drug dealer with a human dignity and love for other human beings is one of the most striking things you will see in a movie. Touching, loving and caring, he is among the most unorthodox drug dealers you would ever see on the screen, while remaining absolutely convincing and realistic as a character.In conclusion, Moonlight is a most delightful and unforgettable example of independent quality film-making. Touching, gut-wrenching and unforgettably intimate, this is a magnificent poem-turned-into-movie about American reality, sexuality and social tension. A most deserved Oscar Best Movie winner, this is a must see modern classic.
  I hear they added Judy Garland singing "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" back. It was originally cut to keep the movie length shorter.
  It's nice to have a story about women and some of the shots are beautiful, but at the end of the day it really is just a movie about a long car chase. It was very tiring.
  While the story was predictible and the characters are bland. the concept is similar to films like fast and furious and how to train your dragon. But however the jokes are pretty decent. With lack of better way of saying it, i feel like it....came out at a wierd time. It is enjoyible to children and i highly recommend it but for 5-12 year olds adults and teens watch just for laughs. Its a okay movie
  King Arthur turns into King "Boredom" With cheap effects rivaling cheap acting in a non-stop , rushed, jumbled together plot that will leave you wondering "Whats going on?" Your better off watching the Disney version

  Cliche Cliche Cliche...Same storyline as part 1 which made us hate it even more. Forced emotions in the movie and trying to be sentimental but didn't work well. Didn't laugh that much and it was "karwata" we khalas. Daddy's Home 2 got them this time as it's almost the same idea but they executed much MUCH better!
  Let's be honest, the appeal of this film only grows with time. The casting is considered perfection. The script: perfection - nearly every piece a dialogue a gem. The songs: too few in the later half of the film, but perfection. The musical score: still catchy, familiar and puts a smile on your face. The special effects: with the exception of the miscued smoke as the Wicked Witch disappears from Munchkinland (watch closely and you'll see it begin prematurely to the left prior to the Margaret Hamilton getting into position), are perfection... the Tornado is STILL a very believable effect 75 years later. It's a right of passage for every child to see it; every child to be frightened of THAT Wicked Witch. It's a shame that the TV landscape has changed such that an annual airing is no longer special. The look of the film - that glorious Technicolor - is unsurpassed. This is one of the finest and most beloved films ever made.
  Not as good as the other Mad max movies with Mel Gibson. The only thing I liked was the intense action in later half of it.
  Just goes to show you don't listen to the 'up their own arse' critics. Highly entertaining, great visual effects,a fresh take on a stale tale. Sure you can pick holes in it but if you want a good,exciting fun movie,i'd give it a serious go.
  First two parts were absolutely amazing but the last part did slow down a bit, but still incredible.
  A timeless classic that feels new and fresh every time I watch.
  Fun movie with good jokes. It does have a life lesson, but it's not pushed so hard that overpowers the comedy.
  The visual effects may be primative and dated compared to today's standards but nevertheless, The Wizard of Oz is still an impressive movie, with memorable characters, unforgettable songs (and God knows we tried to forget them!), and a classic story makes this masterpiece of filmmaking an absolute must-see for kids, adults, and especially movie lovers, and also if you can see it in IMAX 3D while it lasts!
  A great action film. Although it seems that it is just madness and destruction in the film it has a fair share of heart. Tom Hardy does a good job but nothing special like Mel Gibson. Still One of the best films of 2015.
  A compassionate masterpiece with veins that run red with empathy and humanity. "Moonlight" is a story about adolescence, self-discovery, the pains of growing, and the vital importance of compassionate and strong parental roles.One thing that I respect most about this film is the fearlessness found in this film's moments of silence. It's efficient, heavy use of silence that is never without purpose or a function within the narrative.
  Of course it has flaws, it was made 77 years ago! But it is a classic that still bears valuable lessons.
  For all the great things Moonlight did it was overshadowed by its glaring issues as a full-length feature film.Moonlight did some really great things that will be looked back on and even studied by up and coming film students. The cinematography of Moonlight was absolutely astounding and really mirrored the character study and moods that the film portrayed. The direction of photography was also very gripping where it counted. The best thing about Moonlight is the acting, Alex Hibbert as Little Chiron was the most moving part of this film followed by Mahershala Ali as Juan the drug dealer. Both these roles were poignant and so deep that as I watched Moonlight, in the beginning, I was sure this was the best picture of 2016. Then the story played out and the character arcs fell to the sides and Moonlight truly disappointed me.Here is my overall impression as the credits rolled, I was bored and unfulfilled. Moonlight was an interesting film as all character studies are interesting, but I felt disconnected from it. Characters I cared about were not fully fleshed out or just disappeared from the story altogether and without explanation. It's funny that this movie moves from childhood to life as a teenager to young adulthood but the story itself never fills this flow. It's disjointed and leaves the audience behind as it swiftly moves from plot point to plot point. In places where Moonlight could have soared and paid off it's very emotional story it instead switches gears and falls flat. I was so interested in the relationship Chiron had with Juan and Theresa as pseudo-parents and it never pays off or even concludes to move us forward. Instead, it brings us to a climax with Chiron's actual mother and Juan and even this scene is desperately unfulfilling.After I saw the movie I found out it was originally a fifteen-page short story and it makes total sense that the adaptation had problems. Moonlight would have been a better short film or maybe even a pseudo-documentary. It definitely wasn't the best film of 2016 but neither was La La Land in my opinion.
  Fast & Furious+Free Willy+Mcgiver+Pokemon?? lol
  Not as funny as the first one.
  Unfunny.. same old modern humour with vulgar jokes
  It?s a great movie if you?re having a party where everyone is drunk and you need something on your tv. I?d love my money back if possible.
  This film has no ascertainable plot and is merely an acrobatic car chase. The film does not follow the rules of the Mad Mad Universe in which it exists; the primary rule being scarce resources must treated as scarce resources. They waste water, they destroy all their vehicles, the use inordinate amounts of fuel... even driving a stage featuring an electric guitar with a massive flame throwing tower amplification system to every battle..., they loose track of their only non-mutant women, they waste bullets, and despite existing in a post apocalyptic world all their vehicles are some how souped up and pimped out. The actions of the characters just don't make sense when considering the ground rules which the series has created. A science fiction movie can make up any rules it wants, but then it must follow those rules. The film has good acting and cinematography, but does it really matter?
  Flawlessly crafted and well-deserving of the Best Picture Oscar. It takes conventional standards for the underdog movie or hood movie and makes a touching, emotional, and painfully real film.
  Doesn't everyone want to follow the yellow brick road and get to Oz.
  At least the last quarter was good leaving me hopeful that the sequel is better if there is one.
  I see why the academy chose this film as the best picture. At the same time, it feels the same as I have seen before in a coming of age film even with the main character being gay.
  Didn't think this movie would be anything, but it surprised me. Reviews are spot on, this is good. Violent and insanely faced paced, but flows really well and has depth.
  I loved it I thought it was hilarious I highly recommend!
  The worst movie I have ever seen.
  Incredible and a wonderful classic!!
  I know it is just me, but I am not interested in depressing movies about people with no character.
  - The 2013 re-issue looks outstanding on Blu-Ray, excellent use of Technicolor. Look forward to watching with my niece at some time as this one's more for kids, but I still can appreciate the technical achievement. - Hadn't seen this since I was a kid, but decided to check out the 70th Anniversary DVD, and glad I did. The film looked amazing. Not necessarily my kind of movie, but I can see why it's a timeless classic. A must-see for all kids!
  how does this Not get 100%?! Are you $@$@# crazy?!
  As yet another Oz movie is being contemplated, we need to remind ourselves how good the original film was and I think the aged production values allowed it to succeed to griping effect. This was truly another world so much different than the one we encounter today and not one that is easily replicated with today's modern film standards.
  We almost didn't watch this because the reviews seemed low. Watched it with my sons...blew us away. GREAT!! Sometimes movies seem to be up against unfair criticism yet are SOOO GOOD while others are toted as a must see but are very mediocre. I think it's political. This is a great movie.
  Guy Richie does it again. Extremely entertaining movie. Is it absolutely perfect? No. But I will still be rewatching it multiple times. The soundtrack is spectacular, perfect song choice, perfect timing, perfect mood.For those people complaining it's a crappy movie because Richie veered off the original story, get over it. You will actually enjoy the movie if you aren't so afraid of change.
  You will watch it. You will love it. You will watch it again. Then you will listen to the soundtrack. You will find yourself not wanting to let it go. It's a unique experience.
  Il n'y a rien qui ressemble plus à un film de Woody Allen qu'un film de Woody Allen et Wonder Wheel en est un exemple parfait. En effet, cette comédie noire qui n'aurait pu être écrite que par l'auteur new-yorkais est encore une fois un plaisir pour les oreilles et surtout pour les yeux, grâce à une photographie absolument fabuleuse de Vittorio Storaro. Cependant, l'oeuvre est tellement marquée Woody Allen qu'elle ne peut convaincre que les adeptes de son style et laisse sur le bas-côté les non amateurs. Dommage pour eux, car ils manquent deux superbes performance par Kate Winslet et Justin Timberlake.
  The most action I ever saw in a movie. 90% of the stunts were real. It adds to the tension.
  I'm not an anime geek, so therefore I really enjoyed it, I didn't waste any time comparing it to the annimaded version. In fact if it had been animated I wouldn't have been interested. I enjoyed the effects and the visuals alone with the storyline - another element I hadn't previously encountered. Very often if you want the original then watch the original, but if you are happy to view this in its own right then you should let be it. I thouroughly enjoyed it.
  I loved it so much. Way to go Guy Ritchie and Charlie Hunnam.
  Absolutely LOVED Guy Ritchie's fantastical epic tale about one of my most beloved British legendary heroes, King Arthur! How could the critics have gotten this one sooo wrong? Hugely entertaining with a stellar cast portraying engaging characters and amazing storytelling I throughly enjoyed this modern snapshot of how King Arthur rose to the throne. I've seen this movie several times and I am never disappointed... The soundtrack is mesmerizing, sets the tone, and underpins the action perfectly. I only hope there is a sequel!
  Thought it was great , story telling like the movie snatch , with 300 type action and excellent characters
  a good drama. good actors. good storyline. believable. best part filmed in 305. Liberty city represented. and at the last respect and love always wins.
  Everything, that's wrong with today's world rolled into one is this atrocity winning "Best Picture". It seems, that everyone has forgotten, what "cinema" is about.
  classic for all time
  Mad Max, Fury Road brings everything that we liked with the Mad Max franchise and puts it in a long, epic action movie.
  Brilliant and sorely underrated by the official critics.
  A True Fantasy & Musical classic. No wonder it is a bright yellow brick road, because this film is pure gold entertainment (:
  Non stop action that will leave your heart pounding at the end of the movie.
  This film used to creep me out when I was little - nonetheless it's enjoyable :)
  Horrible deviation from the source material. If you are a fan of any of the source material, DO NOT WATCH THIS.
  really good fiml worth seeing bring the story of the world of oz together
  Fun, yet intense, action movie. The filters made the film look cheap and were unnecessary. Definitely watch this film.
  Great experience!! Best quality picture and Sound.
  Mad Max Fury Road reviewAs we started watching Mad Max Fury Road, I had the vibe that this movie was going to be a boring action fiction movie and definitely not going to amuse me and be boring. I do enjoy action movies but from looking at the setting and reading up what it was about, I didn't see that I would enjoy it whatsoever and I wasn't enjoying it at the start. The main character in Mad Max Fury Road is deal was made about the fact that the lead character of the film was a woman, but according to George Miller it had to be that way. When what is being fought over is women, it needed to be a woman who does the fighting. Overall, Furiosa had to be the main character in order to make the story make sense and work. Violence is needed in this film because the plot of fury Road involves many fight and action scenes which leads to violence. It isn't a problem in the movie because it structures the movie together and without violence, I guess the movies wouldn't be that entertaining and wouldn't make sense. As you can tell after watching the full movie, it is 100 percent an unrealistic movie but, that does not matter because miller has set Fury Road in a future desert wasteland where gasoline and water are scarce. What I think millers message is in this movie is that he is telling us what he thinks the future may turn to. As it may seem a little too unbelievable, just remember that aliens are believed to be a myth but yet some in fact many, still believe that they are real existing creatures so who knows. Maybe millers prediction of the future is correct and our country or even earth will turn into a desert wasteland. As said before, feminism does work in the film because Furiosa (the main character) leads and takes risks which is showing the woman are worth the same as men and they are Miller is sending a messages out to the world that the world should be equal and proves that women are strong and can do dangerous and risky things that men can do too. Overall, I did enjoy the film and my opinion of the film changed dramatically from the beginning which is a good thing and means that you have to watch the whole film to enjoy it you can't just watch the trailer to come up with your opinion.
  Mad Max Fury Road is George Miller's return to the franchise he started way back in 1979 with Mad Max. I will start by saying this movie was absolutely batsh** insane. It was filled right to the brim with continuous over the top bloody ridiculous action sequences that keep you on the edge of the seat and just amazed at what Is happening on screen. Now this film doesn't have much of a plot at all but seriously you're not going into this film for an intense plot, this is a film that almost didn't even need one at all. The one thing I was worried about going in was whether I needed to have seen the previous films to understand this one and thankfully you don't, the story is independent of the previous film which was really helpful. The characters were all awesome and it did an amazing job to introduce them all almost instantly and get right into the action. Max (Tom Hardy? and Furiosa (Charlize Theron) were were great and extremely likable characters. Even the villain who I will just call Sweet Tooth was so great, he wasn't anything too special but was a great threat throughout the film. I just absolutely loved this movie, intense action from start to finish and didn't slow down at all, that made it ridiculously fun to watch. The great characters and the performances are awesome on screen and we're always interesting to watch. If there was ever a Twisted Metal movie, this is what it would be. Nothing really let the film down and everything really worked, such a great time and the best cinema experience
  Really cool alternative story for the original. Love it.
  absolutely hysterical!!! just as good as the 1st!
  I really enjoyed this movie. I had doubts because of the critics but I went to see it anyway, and I am so glad I did! Funny, engaging and very entertaining. I loved it and so did my 21 & 40 yr.old sisters and my 13 yr.old niece. I think the critics got it wrong with this one.
  I have no idea. Actually forgot I watched it after 5 minutes. The movie wasn't bad. One time watch.
  Family really enjoyed this movie and wasn't sure if it was going to be that great but I sure was wrong.
  This movie was freaking awesome! I loved it beginning to end. The world building and exposition is incredible in this film. I LOVED the way the flash backs in the beginning filled in WHO King Arthur really was :) the magic was epic and mysterious; the story itself was compelling to me because it had great characters and chemistry on set. It felt very Oceans Eleven meets LOTR... meets MISTBORN. Loved it CANT WAIT FOR KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE. ??????
  Monster Trucks is better than expected.Although the movie delivers some chuckles, the acting in this movie is absolute trash! All the 'Emotional' scenes aren't well handled and that is the fault of both the actors and the Director. Speaking of the director, Chris Wedge, Paramount lured him away from the studio he co-founded, Blue Sky Studios (Ice Age, Rio), to direct this film, was it a good move on Wedge's part, no, although Blue Sky's latest release Ice Age Collision Course is sitting at a 15% Rotten Tomatoes and only managed to rake in $64 Million at the Domestic Box Office, The Ice Age movies are huge hits in the foreign market, The foreign market helped Collision course be a success by making $408 Million worldwide total. Monster Trucks is expected to open with about $10.1 Million and end its run with $22 Million (Domestic), If that ends up being true Paramount Pictures will loose $115 Million! To Monster Trucks' credit they got me to fall in love with Creeth, Yes the CG used to bring Creeth to life is horribly done, his personality was the best thing about this movie, he provided humour and heart! The car chases in this film are also well done, they are thrilling and extremely fun to watch. Overall Monster Trucks is a hot mess, with horrible acting, lousy camerawork and decent humour.5/1050%"C-"Should You See It? If you want to go out and see a movie with your kids then... Go see Sing, but if you have already seen it then this is good too, also a good movie to stream to distract your kids.-Yousef Al-Waeli
  Such a disappointment
  Bad. Acting good in a bad confusing movie.
  This movie by far is one of the most timeless movies in MGM's film history. The entire movie is a fantastic lesson. It's wholesome theme of a girl that just wants to go home. The way the movie starts out black and white then forwards into color is such a great add on for the viewer. This is a must see for all ages; the young will especially love it.
  Wasn't as good as the first, but I laughed from start to finish and left entertained. I recommend it for a good laugh.
  A classic that has stood the test of time. 8/10
  Perfectly simplifies an otherwise obtuse anime series into an easily digestible Hollywood movie. Sure, it'd be nice if the main actress was actually Japanese, but what're ya gonna do?
  Did not even chuckle. Over an hour of bad crude "jokes" with no real storyline. Characters come on screen, say something offensive then move off screen to allow another character to follow suit. Should have watched Thor again instead
  Great movie!! I loved the storyline and the acting was on point.
  A joy for the eyes, a subtle and enchanting cinematic spectacle that speaks somehow the truth for so many people out there who face the worst face of life everyday. It is a moving and neatly executed romance, a fantastic breath of fresh air and simultaneously a predictable one. But it is indeed a worthy oscar winner and for sure the best movie of 2016.
  Looks interesting enough and very beautiful. So why the heck not.
  Cute movie was quite funny
  "There's no place like home." Do I even need to say anymore? This classic film is iconic in every way and a family favorite in nearly every household. PLOT:Young Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland) is a farm girl living in the grey plains of Kansas with her Aunt Em (Clara Blandick) and Uncle Henry (Charles Grapewin). Even though she's a young girl, she dreams big of traveling the lands before her. However, a tornado comes along and sweeps her house up with her and Toto, her little dog, inside. The house comes down in the town of Munchkinland in the wonderful land of Oz. To find her way back home, she has to find the wizard in the Emerald City while avoiding the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton), who's out to get her for dropping a house on her sister. On the way, she meets a Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), a Tin Woodsman (Jack Haley), and a Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr), who choose to accompany her on her journey to see the wizard, wanting a brain, a heart, and courage in return. It's a great plot executed brilliantly. ACTING:The performances in here were really good. Judy Garland played an innocent and iconic role as the young farm girl, Dorothy. Playing well off her and each other, Jack Haley, Ray Bolger, and Bert Lahr performed excellent, iconic roles as the Scarecrow, Tin Woodsman, and Cowardly Lion. I favored Bert Lahr out of the trio, for his performance doubled comedically as it did iconically. Margaret Hamilton also played a great part as the Wicked Witch of the West. She still seems menacing today. The other shiners would be Clara Blandick as Aunt Em, Charles Grapewin as Uncle Henry, Billie Burke as Glinda the Good Witch, Frank Morgan as The Wizard of Oz, and all of the munchkins. There really wasn't a bad performance in here. SCORE:The musical score and soundtrack for this film are iconic, memorable, and catchy to sing as well as to hear. Everybody knows a song from it, whether it's "We're Off to See the Wizard", "Ding-Dong the Witch is Dead", or even "If I Only Had a Brain." Everybody knows the catchy soundtrack to this film. EFFECTS:The effects were astounding back in their time and are still very colorful today. The best effect at the time would have to have been the dramatic and iconic change from sepia/grayscale to Technicolor. That was a dazzling change for people back then and is still a prominent mark in film history. The prop effects were pretty colorful, and the more digital effects (such as the fireballs and the bubbles) were pretty interesting. The effects overall back then were pretty top-notch, but they still stand as interesting to watch now. OTHER CONTENT:This film is iconic on so many levels. Everybody has either seen or heard of the Wizard of Oz, and it's a family favorite for the young children and the older adults. Comparing it to the original book, the film seems to be based only loosely on it. However, this film adaptation improved it from its book form. Everything about this film is really perfect for its time and loveable even today. OVERALL,an epic film with a brilliant plot, really good performances, catchy score and soundtrack, colorful effects, and an iconic legacy left for filmgoers everywhere.
  I hope the SEC is planning to investigate the $115M writedown Paramount/Viacom took on this film. I think that this movie might just be an enormous scam or some kind of insurance fraud. This movie supposedly cost $125M to make. That's a lot of money. $15M more in fact than it cost Sony to make Passengers which starred Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt in a Dubai hotel floating through space. This movie stars Lucas Till as Tripp, Jane Levy as girl, and Dodge logo as a Dodge logo brought to you by Dodge. There is no way that this steaming pile cost $125M to make. That's 2 and a half times the budget of Arrival which again had to pay real actors with real name recognition. This looks like a $50M film max so I'm just curious about what they spend the other $75M on. Maybe they spent it on the rights to film on location at an actual Dodge dealership for literally 20 minutes of the movie. The movie itself was full of flat characters meandering their way through the disjointed plot. Overall it was utterly forgettable which is the absolute worst thing a movie about trucks full of octopi can possibly be.
  Our family loved it. Perfect for kids. Thought the story had a lot of originality and good message. Plot had some twists but easy for kids to understand. Our eight year old and ten year olds loved it. They laughed throughout. Family friendly and clean too.
  My kinf of action films , loved every minute of it .
  Calling this movie one of the greatest action movies ever made is selling it just a bit too short, it's one of the greatest movies ever made. Period.A masterpiece with never a dull moment, George Miller has the highest point (so far) in his career with this astonishing movie.Tom Hardy as the iconic Max Rockatansky, and Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa star in this escort mission of epic proportions.Easily among the greatest action movies ever made, Fury Road ranks with Die Hard, The Bourne Ultimatum, and Lethal Weapon II as one of the greats.
  lo que tiene the wizard of oz es una gran produccion para ser 1939
  One of the best movies of all time. The standard bearer for musical/movies. You'd be hard pressed to find a more influential, quotable movies than this one.
  Somehow a film exists which can appeal equally to people who appreciate Dune and The Fast and the Furious.
  The greatest action movie ever made.
  What can you say about this film? We all had this film introduced to us at that young age where it captivates you with its characters, setting, music and story and still after years still stays the timeless classic that gets better after every watch!
  The reason why "The Wizard of Oz" is so enduring is because it creates Oz perfectly on the screen making an imaginary place actually accessible as well as the fact that it deals with our under appreciation of our lives. Its splendid visuals, warmth, and cheesiness are a must to be embraced.
  Love this movie it is my altime favorite movie
  Amazing amazing movie. Shocked by the critic reviews. Definitely THE most underrated movie of ALL TIME. Amazing visuals, BRILLIANT score, even the acting. Epic, epic epic movie, loved it. Deserved much much more.
  Great movie to watch with your kids.
  Not too many films have flying monkeys in them.
  We just saw Moonlight and were very disappointed. Not the best film of the year. Both La La Land and Manchester By ThSeacwere far better! Was the fix in at the Oscars?
  Barely worthy of a half star. Why take out all of major characters and replace with Caucasian?! Makes little sense. Great viaually, but about it. There's always another anime series to "live-action". Please make progress hollywood. Better luck next time
  Extremely slow, boring and goes nowhere. I kept waiting for it to get better. It never did. $1.50 Redbox rental. Not worth it and it's 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back.
  uh...wow....this movie seems to be trying to start a franchise....not my thing at all...it does go on and on...and, ironically, it basically gets you back to where it started.....glad I didn't see it in the theatre!!! Lots of show and no real go. In DESPERATE need of a story.
  Pretty bad didn't like it.
  So I finally sat through this one. Took me three tries and I really don't understand the hype. Maybe I didn't get it but what's happening besides the action sequences. To me this felt like one long shot of choreographed explosions and extensive violence with little to no character development or background story. If it's all about vengeance the good. Go have your vengeance. I somehow expected a little more depth.
  There are moments of sorrow and brilliant acting but this movies lacks any true sense of excitementDisappointment far outweighs any childhood fears created or even directedMy advice would be to turn it off before it ends with little or no sense of captivation.
  0 Stars! This convoluted mess of a film wants to rewrite the Arthurian legend, only it doesn't know if it wants to be a caper, a war resistance story, or an anachronistic gangster tale. terrible edits and complete fails of logic at various points. Not worth your time.
  This would have been a top film even had it been released 40 years later. Remarkable both technically and as family fare.
  Sensitive and powerful.
  Beautiful story, excellent cinematography. Perfect from the beginning to the end. No wonder it won best movie of the year.
  I didn't like the need to use "f**k" constantly, especially by young kids. Not cool. Not even necessary.
  Just watched King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. It was great. My friends and I all agreed and heard great things before. So we are excited. Good movie with a gamer story line/effect that complimented the story line and invokes a fantasy, once upon a time legend for what is good, yet with a tasty edge. We all hope this becomes a series. Noted that, critics these days have a narsist, raised snout toting, need for negative/pessimisism. It's ruining it for the rest of us. So is the need to base movies from the theater response alone. Time for a change. Great Movie. Hope to see more in this, if not like it.
  Why is doing a boring film about some current social issues always seen as brilliant? This is dull. This is like watching a Gus Van Sant film, and not surprisingly it is just as overrated. Just filming a whole bunch of people moping around isn't brilliant.
  All in all, the film passes the feeling of being incomplete due to shallow plot and the empty characters, the intention to create goals for the main character does not work. The rich scenery and possibilities of the cyberpunk world is sadly harnessed.
  Loved it don?t listen to the reviews awesome movie must see
  Whoever came up with this movie must've been on some serious hardcore drugs.
  So good when you're high and when you're not high. An Academy Award winning film full of action, badass cars, and an overall incredible film despite the simplicity of the storyline. Great costumes, sets, and props as well as award winning cinematography.
  Little, Chiron, Black.
  Mila Mila Mila! Honey, I know you have That 70's Show spark in there somewhere!
  Went with friends for a girls night out and laughed out loud and had a great time. There were even a few teas in the church scene. Sequels are always a challenge because they don't have the surprise factor of the first move, but if you liked the first movie, this one will not disappoint. It is the same characters, tackling the stress of the holidays and the pressure Moms are under to make the perfect Christmas for everyone. If you don't take it too seriously and go for a good laugh, you will enjoy it!
  Smart story with interesting plot turns and witty dialogue. Has that Sherlock Holmes quick storytelling and slow motion action scenes. Well worth seeing, I hope they can do the sequels.
  ummm nonothing about this movie workedmight be good enough for pre teens with all the sillynessbut could scare anyone under the age of 6.i couldn't even tell you what the plot was about nor the car chase at the end. wait for cable. don't waste your time
  this film was the equivalent of getting an abortion in Nicaragua
  Absolutely hysterical. Lot;s of laughs and the whole audience was in hysterics.
  Fantastic and timeless
  Loved every second if it. A classic story, a classic message, remastered on Abigail screen.
  Moments of greatness overshadowed by huge confusing gaps in the story and ridiculously out of place sequences
  Really enjoyed it, but I did with the anime. Not as subtle as that, but still a fun scifi romp.
  1/2, only because I can't give 0
  A good movie but not too much, made me laugh a lot but was too disturbed I loved the first film.
  THIS WAS AMAZING!!!!! NO SHAKY CAM AND A GREAT PLOT!!!! I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!! I WATCHED THIS MOVIE 3 TIMES!!!!!! (probably will see more times)
  Despite all the bad criticism surrounding the movie, I think you need to see it before you pass on it, it's a great movie, more action and wonder than most king Arthur movie. The movie is a breath of fresh air.
  The critics are totally wrong on this one. It was a very entertaining retelling of the story
  Classical and timeless to all ages. The Wizard of Oz tells a reflecting story and their visual works is masterpiece and ground breaking at their own time.
  An excellent first two acts are marred a bit by the somewhat underwhelming third, Moonlight is still a fantastic film with incredible performances, especially from child actor Alex Hibbert.
  I liked slow time part when he held it with two hands
  I would give it a 96%
  Subtlety is a luxury this film doesn't desire dwelling upon. If you're not a fan of explosions and roaring engines, this isn't for you, however what's left is a classic story enjoyable to all and a thrilling blockbuster experience for those who have the proper home theater setups. I give it a 4.5 because this isn't exactly a genre I personally enjoy, but it shines as a powerful film regardless.
  One of the best movies I have seen this year!
  I love this! Glinda: are you a good witch or a bad witch?Dorothy: I'm not a witch at all. I'm Dorothy gale.
  Great movie, very entertaining.
  This time you can believe the hype: Fury Road is one of the most brutal and bone-crunching action films in recent memory, one of the boldest, most original experiences of the year and probably one of the smartest works of dystopian sci-fi to emerge from the current deluge of the same.
  Great Movie. Me and my husband loved it. Mad Max and Furoisa were awesome.
  Very good movie. I'm not sure what people were expecting from the trailers but I believe it delivered what it promised. It was a gritty down to earth spin on the story which turned out really enjoyable if you take it for what it is instead of trying to compare it to other versions.
  This is a great opening, we have never seen how the major came to be and this will do quite nicely, both the cast and direction was spot on, now all we need is a two part follow up using the laughing man as the protagingast keep everything the same +100And a big thank you to cast and crew :)
  9.5/10 The only little flaw I thought was Juan's character, I felt like the film did not explain more of the reason he went from his bad side of town to helping out young Chiron.Moonlight is about the life of Chiron how he has a life with switches of turning events. Chiron starts as a kid that would get picked on by other kids because of his sexual orientation. His mother is a drug addict and he would try to run away to stay with Juan and Theresa who take very good care of him. From there as a kid, Chiron changes phases of growing up while facing the ordeals he has come across with.The film display a lot of development of Chiron's character, it has a lot of meaning in separable ways of life while growing up. Chiron has a friend name Kevin who shows mutual feelings for him too. The changes from his boyhood to teenager to adult were displayed very well from the film. This is the finest story and acting that displays connections to friends and families throughout the film.The soundtrack played smoothly in every part and it calmly transition through scenes. Moonlight definitely deserves that Oscar's choice for best film of 2016. It is remarkable how a this film shows all traits from one focused character.
  Outstanding movie. Everything about this is perfection.
  King Arthur: Legend of bullshit.
  Though the visuals are groundbreaking for it's time and an average story. The unbalanced acting is what overall kills the movie.
  An unhappy housewife has an affair with a young educated lifeguard and wants to leave her husband for him. The side story features the husband's daughter who's on the run from the Sopranos. Pros- Stylish, colorful, and engaging.- Acting is all-around good. I enjoyed Belushi the most. Cons- Feels like I was teased. - There's no ending. - Why Coney Island?Final ThoughtsIt's a Woody Allen movie and it feels like one. He seems to be able to nail down period pieces pretty well. He has a knack for this sort of thing. I'm sure he chose Coney Island because he has his roots in Brooklyn, but this movie could have taken place anywhere. Coney Island itself doesn't do anything other than look pretty in the background. Remove Coney Island and you have the same story. They could be working in an amusement park in California or Chicago. This movie is like being served a small dinner in a fancy restaurant. It looks good and tastes good, but there's just not enough on the plate to keep you full, and you're still hungry for more. The visuals will stay with you more than anything else.
  There's not much I can say about this movie except that its called a classic for a reason! A-
  A visually striking movie, great story line, kept elements of the anime movie and tv series while adding new twists.
  I saw it and it was just as entertaining as it was the first time I saw it as a kid! Really cute movie.
  LOVED IT!!!!! It had much more detail and clarity!!!
  Cuando crees que no puede haber nada peor que Dioses de Egipto llega Monster Trucks a demostrar que siempre puede haber algo peo.r
  breath of fresh air with all the crap that is being made recently
  The tin man is a fag
  I'm just wandering why Dorothy will miss Scarecrow the most.
  Excellent acting and suspense, Mad Max is great showcase of action, Charlize Theron and practical effects.
  I'm not a fan of musicals, so I was surprised I liked this at all
  The Wizard of Oz is one of those movies that is admired in the past, but in the future it gets criticized. But in the past, it was really good. The costumes were admired in 1939 because they were realistic at the time. The story was perfect, nothing wrong with it. The characters are fun and amazing. The acting was great. The Wizard of Oz is going to get a good score for me.
  not good bad visuals and storytelling must not watch
  Holy shit this movie is fucking awesome. Best movie of 2015. Although the movie has almost no plot to speak of. The action makes up for it. The CGI and practical blend in magically, and at some points I have trouble telling the difference. This movie was everything I wanted and more. If you haven't seen this movie yet, go see it for fucks sake. Best action movie I have seen in a long time.
  Not really sure what to write. I know that everyone was talking about this movie and how great it was but I think it was the subject matter that they enjoyed. I wasn't entertained. The ending was one of the most anticlimactic endings I've endure in awhile
  A nice little surprise two summers ago was the movie Bad Moms. It was a funny little comedy that had some good laughs. So in normal Hollywood fashion, a sequel was quickly made and it isn't good. Any time a movie needs 6-7 music montages during the film, you know it isn't good. If it wasn't for Kathryn Hahn, this movie might be the worst of the year. She at least has a few good lines and so does Christine Baranski. I mean some of the scenarios in this thing are so unrealistic, it just sapped the fun away from me. I know I can be hard on some of the 'chick flicks', but even my wife wasn't too crazy about this one. Ladies, maybe you will need an outlet while us dudes are checking out Thor this week, but you can do better.
  Fifteen years after the premier showing in 1939 I was able to see the original movie as the Wizard of Oz was available to be experienced again. I was memorized by the film and I remain the same today. Now, in 3D for home theaters, I found the movie again a thrill to watch. The color is even more beautiful and the added 3D and the classic will remain in the hearts of the people forever.
  This movie was great! I have seen both movies and they both made me laugh. I'm happy I seen this!!
  a bit heavy but still a good movie
  Screw the critics, this was a fun movie and I enjoyed the different story and the guy richie style. From the scene a few minutes in at the brothel (the story telling style that is pure guy richie)I knew this movie would rock and it did.
  I really enjoyed this movie...It's not for everybody, but it definitely made me laugh!
  3D for you and your little dog too!
  Post-apocalyptic movies are awesome, but I absolutely enjoyed this one, Eventually I will watch its predecessors because it's an interesting world. Also.... I loved the music
  Didn't think it was as bad as some people said. It wasn't true to the original stories, but it was a well-done re-imagining.
  Good, yes. great, no.
  Actions and visual effects are great.
  A sweet and adventurous fable that arrests you with its loveliness and inescapable charm. Potentially the most beautiful movie ever made.How could anyone have known that Victor Fleming would change cinema forever with two films in the same year? Not only did he set a whole new standard for how epic films are made with "Gone with the Wind" but he also shaped the future of movies forever with this impeccable work of art. No question, "The Wizard of Oz" is a total masterpiece.
  I added extra half star just for the totally awesome soundtrack, too bad the movie itself was such a horrible mess with so many things crammed in there, it would be enough for 3 more movies. Ugh.
  Moonlight disappointed me, primarily because it could easily have been a much better movie Director Barry Jenkins takes the main character, Terence, beyond brooding, alienated, and painfully withdrawn... all the way to boring. We were deprived of Best Supporting Actor Oscar winner Mahershala Ali's outstanding acting only 10-20% of the way through the story and - along with it - an abrupt end to the first of many story lines. The cast (other than Ali) did not provide compelling performances, too many ideas and characters were never developed, and perhaps the only truly unique twist to the central theme was that the main character was gay. Even many influences of the latter were never well-explored.Taken together, these are the main reasons why I thought Moonlight was an interesting concept and story, but could have been a much better movie.By way of comparison, my standard reference for the theme of Black children coping with desperate inner city environments, devoid of hope, is the 1994 film "Fresh". We could quibble about differences in details between the two movies, but everyone from the writers to the director to a young Sean Nelson (supported by Samuel L. Jackson and others) did a better job than did their Moonlight counterparts. Fresh - as a story - certainly had at least one distinct advantage. Unlike Moonlight, which ended with a quasi-cliche sense that a kid with Terence's reality will become a victim of his environment (except for the resolution of his long suppressed homosexuality), Fresh offered a very interesting perspective on how a kid might be able to do better than that... even if he cannot escape his environment.I do not understand how Moonlight could have been voted Best Picture because, not only do I think it was not, I do not consider it even among the best 2016 films focused on the lives of African Americans.Fresh was ahead of its time and - for what it is worth - if both films had been released in 2016, I believe far more Best Picture Oscar votes would have been garnered by Fresh than Moonlight.
  Why are Mila Kunis' - who is of Ukrainian Jewish heritage - parents northern European in this movie? Why can't her parents be more realistic? Hollywood, you suck!
  what a classic. just wonderful
  Construit sur trois actes parfaitement homogènes, ce qui est déjà en soi une énorme réussite, Moonlight est une remarquable étude de personnage, qui parvient à mêler énormément de thèmes sans pour autant que l'un cannibalise les autres. Les 3 acteurs qui jouent le rôle de Chiron parviennent à créer un personnage cohérent sans pour autant se ressembler vraiment, tandis que Janelle Monae et Mahershala Ali sont absolument parfaits. Moonlight est un film remarquablement mis en scène, tout en retenue et en douceur, sans jamais tomber dans le misérabilisme. Moonlight est un très grand film.
  A hot mess of impressive visuals and bland psychobabble. And then there's the whitewashing...
  A very well made 2 hour long music video...hardly any dialogue or plot...I was so bored didn't make it through the whole thing...I'm glad it didn't get more than technical Oscars.
  This is one of the best movie i have ever see
  An instant classic with catchy songs and fun characters.
  It had/has potential, but neither Ritchie or Hunnam ends up making much of it.
  so good you will die
  A classic piece of cinematic beauty that will be cherished for years to come.
  Omg a funny great family film it's very funny bu lacks a good plot , and character development. But overall amazing.
  We watched this last night and it was an interesting drama about the struggles of some people.
  Amazing! Beautiful and complex.
  Mad Max: Fury Road is a sequel / reboot of the 1980's film franchise directed by original director George Miller. The film stars Tom Hardy (Max Rockatansky), Charlize Theron (Furiosa) and Nicholas Hoult (Nux). It has good acting from all of the actors involved however, Tom Hardy character does not have too much character development when compared to the rest of the cast. There are amazing balls to the wall action set pieces that are very well choreographed and beautiful to look at. This film is excellent but it has a very simple plot.
  Succeeds as a live-action anime, but offers little of anything else.
  I grew up watching this movie and I love it but I wish it would have been closer to the original story
  I remember watching this film almost every year as a child. To me it defined the magic of cinema. I still love watching it. The players, music, direction and production make many of today's efforts look weak in comparison.
  For me just an average movie with an important life story involved. Shows the double struggle of growing up by being black and on top of that being gay. At times it was tough to watch the maing characters struggles, but a movie that tells the story decently. For me I saw this movie because of all the obvious hype, and agree that the acting was over the top, but all through the movie seemed like something was missing that I can't quite put my finger on!
  This film is too classic a tale, The wizard of Oz is the definition of a film Icon and movie magic.
  This overall was a great action movie.
  The Wizard of Oz is a wonderful movie that deserved to be a classic! The Wizard of Oz is a delightful treat for everyone of all ages! Everything I have seen in this movie is amazing! It has magic the whole family will enjoy. The movie is filled with great performances, music and songs.A tale from L. frank Baum, The Wizard of Oz tells the story of Dorothy, (played by a legendary Judy Garland), a young farm girl who live in Kansas. One day, an earthquake appears and takes Dorothy and her dog, Toto to the magical world of Oz, a place filled with pure imagination. While in Oz, she meets the Wicked Witch of the West, who really loves those red ruby shoes she has on. While she tries avoiding the witch, the nice creatures and people in Oz tell her to follow the yellow brick road. While walking, she meets a scarecrow, a tin man, and a lion. They all wish that had something that would be so special to them, The Scarecrow wishes for a brain, The Tin Man wishes for a Heart, and The Lion wishes for Courage, but Dorothy has the biggest wish of them all, to get back home to Kansas. They all must go see the Wonderful a Wizard of Oz which leads them to an adventure filled with creatures, weird people, and the Witch. The Wizard of Oz is a beloved classic for everyone. The songs are great, the music is wonderful, the screenplay is magnificent, the acting is fantastic, and the effects are really well done. The art direction is fantastically beautiful, the costume design is amazing, and the adventure in the movie triumphs! I think this should have won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1939.
  Mad max: fury Road, mad max furia en el camino En un futuro post-apocaliptico donde lo único que importa son los vehículos motorizados y la gasolina existe un loco llamada max, un expolicía que es acosado por los vivos y por los muertos entrelaza cu camino con furiosa una chica que planea una rebelión contra inmortal un dictador que tienen a todo su pueblo en la miseria muertos de hambre y sed.Hablando de lo bueno y de las primeras buenas noticias que supimos desde antes del estreno de la película es que Hiba a ser dirigida por el mismo George Miller, justamente el director de la trilogía original de mad max el cual debo mencionar que mientras más viejo está Miller mejor dirige películas el es la prueba viviente de que la vejes no te vuelve inútil, otro punto muy bueno de la película son los mismos personajes, todos son muy llamativos e interesantes, sobre todo el personaje de furiosa, es increíble y fue un gran acierto el no sexualisarla como lo hacen el 90% de los directores actuales a la hora de hacer un personaje femenino.El soundtrack es bestial y va muy bien con las escenas y la temática de la película, los efectos especiales son grandiosos de echo no existe el CGI en la película, todo es maquillaje y utilería que le da un toque muy clásico que nos recuerdan a las películas de acción de los 70s, y si está película como toda película de acción tiene explociones cada 5 segundos pero Miller los supo usar de una forma increíble mostrando la vulnerabilidad ante el daño de los personajes, mostrándonos que son humanos, sin duda la saga rápidos y furiosos tiene mucho que aprender de este filme.Puntos malos: realmente no pude encontrar puntos malos tan así para mencionarles.En conclusión: está película es increíble y grandiosa, la recomiendo a todo el mundo tanto publico cinéfilo como crítico y casual.
  It was a Mad Max movie, without Max. That is, once you get about a third through. The beginning was a Road Warrior-esque adrenaline shot, with an enticing plot introduction that has you wondering just how and what Max will do to stop Immortan Joe dead in his tracks. Then, you meet the wives, and especially, Furiosa. Soon after you forget that Max is even involved, because all he does is become a near-designated driver and action prop. All of a sudden, Furiosa is some maim character that we didn't ask for, but would have appreciated if the roles of her and Max were reversed. The wives are dead weight, another excuse just to make Joe slightly angrier and more motivated to stop Ma- well, Furiosa, when the rig would have been just fine to defend. Then there's this crash at the end that's a middle finger to the viewers
  Classic family film.
  Saw the movie after it won Best Picture. Is it a good film? Yes. Is it the best film I saw out of all that was in the category? No. However it is a good story and I did enjoy Ali's performance.
  this movie should die already
  Incredible story. No glitz, no glam, just the nitty gritty of it all. Incredibly strong cast!
  story was ok acting good had a great cast it was a fun movie not boring
  Mad Max Fury Road came out of nowhere and was a fun exhilarating joy ride throughout the entire film. When the soundtrack booms as exciting action plays, you can't help but feel adrenaline rushing through your veins. Everything was great about it, but if it had more of a story, it would be perfect.
  "Holy Sh*t" is all I can say
  Terrible. I had no idea what was going on the entire time. I was trying as hard as I could to keep my eyes open.
  Was absolutely bored throughout this movie, nothing happened and when something was building up it just went cya and fucked off back to walking around. The only mild entertainment was staring at Scarlett Johansson. All style but no plot. I also haven't seen the anime nor do I ever plan to.
  Superb action and special effects
  A bit ridiculous, but action packed and entertaining enough for a watch.
  so much fun. I will watch it again for sure.
  The greatest family film of all time, with unforgettable music and songs (like the Oscar-winning "Over the Rainbow"), likable characters and the universal theme that there is indeed "no place like home."
  technically superb. imaginative setting and characters. but wow, what a drab story line. roles were grade-school shallow. acting wasn't required. over-the-top war carnage was hollywood trademarked, meaning of course, the heroes survive anything but dismemberment. in all, could have been just as impressive as a 15 minute film without wasting an hour plus of one's life.
  Best Movie of the year.
  Not many laughs. Very formula driven. R rated because of a bunch of F bombs. Mostly stupid. My wife, who saw Bad moms 1, loved it. I thought it was stupid. Wait for it to be on HBO.
  Just saw Moonlight yesterday. Great acting, but have no idea how it won Best Picture over fantastic movies like Hidden Figures, Lion and Hacksaw Ridge.
  i really liked this movie there is very famouse story of king Arthur's and exhalibur and i think its good movie.
  I can't even begin to list all the ways this movie sucked. The few slightly promising elements, such as the development of the friends who would eventually become the Knights of the Round Table, or some of the more obscure parts of Arthurian legend making it into the film (e.g. the stone being the body of Arthur's father), get hidden under a steaming pile of shit which they've tried to make look pretty with way to much visual effects. I pity the actors for not having the opportunity to show their acting skills (and for having this on their resume). Usually I can ignore the crappiest plot if the fight scenes are good but these were just a guy running along swinging his sword at people who couldn't fight him. *yawn* I'm gonna go watch paint dry now.
  Moonlight is undoubtedly a cinematic masterpiece.
  The director said he was a fan of John Boorman's Excalibur... well, Boorman's Excalibur was 100% better than this piece of @#%!. Uninteresting characters... buffoons instead of knights... what a DISASTER of a movie...
  Well after MAD MAX:BEYOND THE THUNDERDOME, i was quite sceptical as to how this cult-classic saga might get back on the right track. MAD MAX and MAD MAX: ROAD WARRIOR were such superior that BEYOND THUNDERDOME was a little bit of regression compared to them. Also a question was lingering: would a new mad max movie have the same mind-blowing effect 2015 as it had in 1980?. To this question my answer was rather 50-50 but george miller proved not only me but, i suppose, many WRONG!!!!This guy is simply what you call a great director. MAD MAX:FURY ROAD takes its stand from ROAD WARRIOR but with the essence of the first movie. Tom Hardy does a great job as MAX ROCKATANSKY but its Charlize Theron's FURIOSA who stole the show; indirectly, this movie is a female-lead action packed explosive fun ride.Dazzling visuals, mind-blowing actions and a great performance by the lead as well as the secondary cast and the vision of a legend like george miller simply makes MAD MAX:FURY ROAD one of the best movies of 2015 and certainly a cult-classic action movie which will be remembered for years just as its predecessors.
  It is an interesting story and keeps you watching but the end of the movie leaves you hanging. You can only assume what happens in the end but it is never really told.
  Having just read L. Frank Baum's book "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" and subsequently watching the classic 1939 MGM film, I thought I'd do a review of the movie.First of all, let me say that I thoroughly enjoyed Baum's book and I can see why it is a classic and the source of so many adaptations. That said, the 1939 film really takes this source material to a new level. The problem with Baum's book is that it is a series of episodes that, on its own in written form weaves a magical tale. But, if one imagines the story filmed exactly as is, I believe you'd see a rather slow and, at times, cumbersome film. The writers and filmmakers of "The Wizard of Oz" take the best of Baum's original work and create a narrative that has drama and intrigue.Whereas in the book the Wicked Witch of the West really only appears in a few chapters and is really only a threat to the Wizard, the movie creates a real enemy for not only the people of Oz, but for Dorothy and Company. She appears throughout the film constantly watching and trying to foil Dorothy's attempt to get to the Wizard. One of the best examples of a change from the book is that it's the Wicked Witch who casts a spell on the poppies to make Dorothy and the Lion fall asleep. Glinda, who's also monitoring the situation, gives them a little help, allowing them to escape. In the book, Dorothy and the Lion fall asleep because that's what poppies do and they end up getting rescued by a bunch of field mice. While its fun to read about the field mice, in a film situation, it is much more compelling to see this little bout between good versus evil.Another big change that the film makes from the book is connecting Kansas to Oz. Several of the characters Dorothy meets are based on the people in her life. She is protected in Oz by the same people who help protect her as farm hands on Uncle Henry's and Auntie Em's farm. And, moreso, she is threatened by somebody who suspiciously looks like the Wicked Witch of the West. It's a brilliant storytelling device.Finally, one cannot fail to mention all the classic music involved. "Somewhere Over The Rainbow" is not only one of the most memorable songs of not only the film, but of all time. The songs are very much characters in the film that also help move the story along in a way that is fun and capture the spirit of Oz.I've always loved this film, but, after having read the book, it really makes me appreciate the film in a much greater way than I have before.
  Surprisingly, I am very pleased with this movie.. Especially the soundtrack! it's amazing!!
  The Wizard Of Oz, one of cinema's most outstanding masterpieces of all time, with its magistral visuals, catchy, memorable & inmortal songs and excellent characters, everyone of them very-well developed, and great storytelling. A timeless classic of musicals and cinema history.
  Wow, I don''t get all the hype. Really didn't like this movie.
  Okay. Sit down, buckle up and enjoy the ride. This film has everything for action fans. George Miller delivers stunning imagery, and a cleverly interesting plot. The main characters deliver with believable performances. The action sequences which are many, are jaw dropping and get your heart pumping. This is the best all around action film in many years...IMHO.
  Mad Max Fury Road advances the Action Movie genre from the 1980's and transforms. The greatest effects here is the intricate ballet of action movie moments woven sometimes layers deep into the long battle scenes, with a wide range of emotion. If The Road Warrior is Miller's Illiad, Mad Max Fury Road is his Aeneid.
  worst Movie of the year, plot is insulting to humanity and a reflection of everything that is wrong with the world.
  I'm not going to write this comparing it to the original Mad Max film, I just don't think it's worth while to do so, they're just different movies and casts (get over it!). I WILL say on that note that this movie is as impressive today as the original MM was then... perhaps even more so. This was truly one of the most insane movie going experiences I've ever had. It's like a Burning Man, Cirque de Soliel, inverted Blue Man Group mash-up acid-trip in the best possible sense. Low on story complexity and script but overflowing with art, camp and very intricate, flawlessly executed action sequences. That said, there are some over-the-top moments I could have done without for sure (guitar-guy!?), but there was such attention to detail in almost every single frame that it's almost irresistibly artful in its way. There's just something really impressive here. The performances are very strong considering the restraints of an almost non-existent script, and the action is simply unprecedented in this genre (IMO). The intro scene alone of the film is so good and tight that the theatre actually broke out in a smattering of applause just for that. At the end of the movie all you can do is laugh and applaud in exhaustion, trying to comprehend the unyielding bombastic action and absurdity of what the hell it was you just witnessed. Now you have to keep an open mind that if you only like say Wes Anderson films, or rich scripted little art house films, this is NOT going to be your jam, in fact you're probably going to loath it. But if you're like me and you have room in your world for any well executed art regardless of genre this is just not a movie to be missed. Trust me, it's much more enjoyable than your hollow, run-of-the-mill action movie.
  What can I say about Judy Garland' s Wizard of Oz? Nothing except for beautiful!! Follow the yellow brick road!
  Empty and boring. I'm honestly offended this won Best Picture at the Oscars.
  I'm helplessly ignorant about the tale of King Arthur, so I had no loyalty to the story to disappoint. I loved the modern style of this medieval movie. Great cinematography and characters were easy to love. My favorite movie since Mad Max Fury Road.
  Very funny light hearted movie. A great Christmas watch.
  King Arthur: Legend of the Sword overuses style heavy action sequences which takes out the classic feel to the legend of King Arthur while the plot builds up too much for the audience to keep engaged.
  amazing but has flaws well a few flaws but I truly can't understand the hateit's amazing9 out of 10
  A must see fantasy adventure fun for everyone! Judy Garland was a delight!
  One of the best uses of colour I've ever seen in film, and simply the most fully realized universe I've been sucked into in quite some years. Just an incredibly kinetic film, always moving, with wonderful performances. I know some people are lambasting the story, but I found it a relief to show a movie that presented a narrative without ever getting bogged down in exposition (there is definitely a narrative, simple as it may be). Part of me wishes it was just a smidge shorter, but overall definitely one of the most impressive blockbusters to come along in quite some time.
  Now a lot of you snowflakes may call me a sexist. But check me out, I gave glowing reviews on the feminist movie!! Proves that I am honest about my reviews. Not like you snowflake crybabies. Now back to the movie. Plenty of action and really like the dope mad motors.
  better than expected. very entertaining!
  There is very little to this movie and I was very disappointed in it. Basically a boy grows up. He happens to be gay, at least once, and he barely speaks. That's about it. There is no plot other than boy grows up. It's like that movie of a boy's life a few years ago, really nothing happens except everyone ages. It's also full of stereotypes and cliches. When will movie makers do a movie about a girl growing up? We have two now about boys aging into men, let's see some movies about girls becoming women and all the crap we have to go through just to survive. Moonlight is overrated and very depressing.
  One word; outstanding!
  For me, this movie was in the category "I haven't watched this yet, but people are saying it's really masterpiece" I know that I needed to find time to watch it earlier... I did it yesterday using boxxy software and I regret that I didn't watch it before...When you know that everything you watch is for free and your software is for free it's the real pleasure!
  Once again I love it when people give reviews without seeing a movie just to post something. We just saw the movie and the audience was full of parents with and without kids. The whole audience was laughing and cheering. Just a fun feel good movie and will see it again. Just good fun family fil for a change....no wonder critics paned it.
  Moonlight was a challenging yet important task for the film industry- it confronted difficult social situations and brought light to the complex and confusing times of adolescence. Its attention to nuance both in script and in cinematography was what made the movie the large success that it was. Additionally, It was an especially important moment for African Americans in film, as it offered many important roles (and subsequent award nominations) to this minority, as they empowered the black identity as well as the homosexual identity- important on their own, and at their intersection.Katherine Fox, May 2017Freeman School of Business/ Tulane University
  Just loved it to the bone. It's a piece of art, a cinema lesson and a directorial resurrection. Makes you love movies!
  Brilliant cinematography, loved everything about this film..
  Absolutely LOVED this movie!! What a breath of fresh air!! Thank you Guy Richie and all the cast and crew for making such a great film! Soooo much better than many of the other films that are getting better reviews. I don't know what people's deal is, this is a GREAT movie. Finally an entertaining film actually worth seeing!!
  Not the film i was expected, white washing is bad stuff
  This is probably my favorite movie ever. Great music and performances.
  Classic and almost unbeatable
  A classic film for everyone. Though it may be a bit to scary.
  i already saw this movie a ok movie
  At the cinema this week I also saw mindless, meaningless, video game-esque action for 2 hours, in the form of King Arthur Legend Of The Sword. I went in to King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword open-minded, but was disappointed. I can understand why critics are up in arms over this movie. King Arthur is a style over substance film; these films can be great if combined with some story-telling - but this film had very little. Lack of any meaningful character development in King Arthur meant that despite decent acting, I wasn't invested in the scraps of story. King Arthur's problems don't stop there: over-the-top, unrealistic violence undermines any sincerity this film had. It's a hot mess. As I said, King Arthur has decent acting and there's some clever film-making from Guy Ritchie in the transitions between time periods, but King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword had little else to offer. For a classic tale to be given this treatment is sad.
  Brilliant. Shame it wasn't as mesmerizing as the original.
  Another bad anime-adaptation. Sad, because for once they got the visuals down to a point; the story, however, is ridiculously dumbed down, simple, and quite frankly an insult to the complex themes present in the original.Sure, it works as an action flick, the same way you can make a Schindlers List-remake would work as an action flick. It doesn't mean you should.This is basically the problem with all anime-adaptations nowadays. Lack of respect for the source material. Imagine all media treated equally, would you believe someone could succesfully remake The Godfather, The Usual Suspects, Star Wars, and the aforementioned Schindlers List? No, you wouldn't. So why do directors and producers think they can manage exactly that when it comes to anime? I wonder when they are going to slaughter Ghibli-films, making a search-for-identity film out of Ponyo, or an Avatar 3 out of Mononoke.It's a damn shame, I had my hopes up for this one, but save for a few moments where they actually recreated some iconic scenes, this movie is a condescending mess.
  I can't believe this movie was so poorly reviewed by the critics. It is not supposed to be a historical portrayal. It's Guy Ritchie's own spin and it's a good one. Charlie Hunnam is spectacular as well. Plays the role spot on.
  Good Movie Good Classic
  Pretty horrible movie. Mad Max is basically just a glorified taxi driver. This movie isn't even about Mad Max. I felt ripped off when I watched it. Also, all the women in it are sour, bitter, hateful feminists. Very unpleasant movie for Mad Max fans.
  If you saw the previews, than you saw the funny moments. This B Moms was not even 1/2 the movie as the first, and does not work as a comedy, zero Christmas qualities, or doesn't even work as a women bonding movie. This one started with a good first 20min, and then just went flat. They tried to use the F word to get laughs, and it loses its shock value in the first scene. Try Thor, 90+ rating, that non comic book fans, and even your female or male date will enjoy. Even if you haven't seen the other two. Sorry bad moms, but when you throw out a sequel in less than a year, than trash is what you get. Hopefully Daddys Home 2 will be a better holiday hit. This first one of the season was bore, that not even the good cast could keep even the women entertained with.
  I thought Carol Burnett s character is very harsh and mean spirited and a racist to & on Christmas really wow
  Quite okay in fact. Not perfect, but Guy Richie managed to pull something off quite well. Much like his Rock N'Roll version of Sherlock Holmes, this interpretation uses the same type of formula. The fight scenes are elegant and the style of the movie is appreciable. The pacing seemed rushed a bit on the first half of the movie, but the use of magic and lore do it for me. Just please.. to all movie directors... Stop it with the shaky cam !
  Ghost in the Shell is a beautiful and well directed movie. The world that was created back in the original anime has been very masterfully recreated. Though the movie added some new plot points and some more aspects to certain characters, it stayed pretty close to the formula the original used. It was great to see some of the most iconic scenes from the first film remade in live action. This movie does have issues though, some of the things they added to the movie that I mentioned earlier don't work well. There were also some scenes that felt very awkward and lines that were cheesy, but overall I enjoyed this movie. So if you loved the original you will more than likely enjoy this movie.
  The story is compelling, painting a picture of lives in struggle against strong themes. The musical score envelopes the story and brilliantly heightens the emotion of scenes. In spite these things and strong, gripping performances by the actors, the movie falls victim to itself and incredibly slow pacing.
  A classic that lives on despite advances in technology. It starts off in a brownish hue in Kansas where she gets caught in a storm and gets knocked out. She travels to Oz in full color and crushes the wicked witch of the west and is given her ruby slippers. She tries to follow the yellow brick road to find the wizard and make it back home. Along the way, she meets the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion (as well as a bird who people think is a dead Munchkin). It's a classic story that's been revisited a few times over the years, but this one still holds up quite well. The sets are a bit cheap by today's standards, but that's a product of the time. Still one of the all time great movies.
  In world of action flicks that consistently fail to create their own style, tone, or even story, George Miller's film towers above them all and shouts back down, "Hey! See this? This is how you make an action movie!"
  I have to side with the critics on this one. The fast paced, fast talking, straight weird delivery left me uninterested. I left the theater before it finished.
  A spectacular pleasure. The Wizard of Oz is exactly what it intends to be: a pleasant, enjoyable,and playful romp through Oz with a colorful cast of characters.
  Beautifully understated. A masterpiece.
  An all time classic that will live on for ages.
  Is everyone going berserk? The critics and audience members who rated this highly are clearly sniffing too much gasoline. Raging adrenaline, testosterone, dystopian nonsense, and pointless, repetitive crazy a$$ chases to distract from lack of plot, character or redeeming values. Why are worthy actors like Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron in this? Maybe they thought this would be more fun to perform than it is to watch. Someone on bad drugs might get all hyped-up over this crazy crapola. But if your brain is still functioning and you have any shred of decency left in you, avoid this like the plague.
  Really liked it. As I did the anime. Will edit once I watch it again.
  Absolutely TERRIBLE!!!
  I liked it. It's better than Caffe Society. Not Allen's best work, but is still him, talking about the nature of relationships. It has a few worthy lines.
  Great classic has frightening moments but innocent overall! Ages 7+
  I may have given it a 4 and whilst it's not on a level with James Bond, IT, Taken, The Hobbit, Harry Potter etc as movies, the humor is what brings this up. 2017 has me seen Jigsaw, IT, Suburbicon, The Ritual so it was nice to see something on the colorful and comedic side as opposed to a Story or Horror.
  I don't know what everyone is banging on about, purists no doubt I thought it did a great job. There's nothing about it I didn't like! Feel bad it got a mediocre response I'd recommend it. Maybe there could have been some more complexity to the plot as it's a thriller at heart, slightly predictable but not enough not for me to be engaged throughout, I thought the balance between action and themes and imagery was very well handled and the casting was great too. And a great length at 1.47 pleased to see a film not fanny around like the good old days
  I love this fantastic story that is really just a very long technicolor dream.
  Since they decide to play it EVERY christmas, I now cant st
  Guy Ritchie is a master story teller. He really uses visuals in this film to draw you in. This is truly an origin story, well told and the beginning of an epic journey - if it hadn't been cut terribly short by a poor performance in the box office. Some of the characters in the story did not necessarily get the screen time they needed in order to be developed, but the reason is that the King Arthur film was meant to be several films long, which would have allowed ample time for every character to be fine tuned and experience a full character arc. I wish I had the privelege of seeing a sequel, but I know that it will never happen. Hats off to Guy Ritchie for taking another famous tale and recreating it in his visually thrilling style of filmmaking.
  The glorious non-stop action film that no one ever seems to get right anymore has returned! Not only that, but it has arrived within a fantastically-detailed and well-realised world that isn't afraid to be freaky or unconventional. instead, it thrives on such characteristics.The cast are great (even though Hardy really isn't doing that much) and it's Furiosa who comes out as the real star- she may well simply oust Mad Max altogether and take his place (as long as Theron doesn't start saying the kinds of things that Mel Gibson does...)It's a giant chase movie and it has a ton of action and instantly-quotable lines and a great villain and a rich and beautiful world to explore. I sound like a little boy as I try and summarise it but that's just how exciting this film is- seeing it was like watching Die Hard for the first time as a kid; the whole time I was just thinking 'man, that's awesome'. It's rare that a straight-up action film grabs me in that way anymore. With most good action flicks I' d add the usual 'switch your brain off and dig in' line but for this one you can rest assured- feel free to delve into the film's meaning/social commentary/whatever because enough care and attention has went into that that you might actually take some things away from it if you go down that route. This is a smart action film that is still an action film at its core- it isn't trying to make us think, it just wants to entertain us and gives us some extras to go with it. EVERYTHING LOOKS REAL TOO (I only saw one shot where I felt like the effects took me out of the movie- ONE SHOT OUT OF SO, SO, MANY OF THEM). I was looking too- I was trying to catch it out, but, no Fury Road packs a real punch and you can see it right in front of you (unless all of the dust gets in your eyes!Whilst I clearly love this film, I will say that I was somewhat disappointed with how it began to come to an end. It's satisfying and fair but I also found it somewhat anti-climactic and just a little too easy- this film could easily have went on for another half hour without it even slightly beginning to bore due to its fast pace and constant action. I think it went for a happy ending (well, 'happy' in the context of its deranged world) and I'm not sure that it had to play it quite so safe. Also I wasn't hugely interested in Max's flashbacks as they just didn't feel necessary with so much else going on. Anyway, enough talk- WATCH IT. IT IS GLORIOUS.
  Not only is it story telling at its finest but it's cinematic art. Also love how low budget it is. Inspiring performance by Maherahala Ali. It's a must watch.
  fantastic visuals storylines was ok
  when a 7 year old calls a movie stupid you know just how bad this kids movie is.
  I have never been a fan of post-apocalyptic films, but Fury Road's characters and cinematography were enough to keep me interested and its plot and acting also were pluses. Overall the only aspect that kept me from rating this film higher is the ridiculous stunts and at times cheesy attempts to appeal to the younger generation.
  This movie is amazing! If I had to pick something I didn't like my only complaint is that I didn't want it to end! The action, the cars, the acting, the characters, the plot... excellent all the way around. I've watched it around 20 times and it still blows me away.
  loved it and Charlie is so good in this roll
  Wizard of Oz..enough said!
  Horrible , I don't get all the hype! La la land should've got the award!
  Ook de 2e keer blijft het een geweldig bangelijke goeie film!
  Mindnumbing. Overrated. Fury Road is a grotesque, dust-bowl carnage, sustained by the ecstatic, theological riff to "Valhalla!" Beyond that, this film's succinct and albeit original narrative has little else to say.
  I read as King Arthur as I could get my hands on as a kid. I don't recall him being a Kung-Fu master.
  Even though this film is now nearly 500 years old its still as popular as ever, losing none of the sparkle and standing up incredibly well over time.If it can keep a 4 year old used to 21st century T.V. happy then you know its still good..
  Beautiful, action packed movie with a soundtrack that blew me away. Actions scenes are directed in such a way that you feel the power of the sword and it's breathtaking. Definitely recommended for everyone interested in kdark fantasy. Although it doesn't keep too many things from original story I didn't have any problems with that.
  This movie is so fucking horrible! So boring! No emotion! No fun! No meaning! 1/10
  Great movie it was entertaining as it should be, different yes and why not
  Meh. Vehicles were cool though.
  One of the most overrated films I've ever paid to see. A snooze fest with zero dialog, zero character development, & zero plot. I'm sure there will be a sequel...that I won't watch.
  Did anyone else notice that all the good girls ride airheads?
  Historically beautiful, even if there's nothing to it
  Meh. Visually stunning, but the story was not too great. I wish the director would scrap the "Sherlock" style of directing. This movie felt too modern for what it was. Gives me HUGE doubts for my highly anticipated Aladdin live action. Let's hope for the best.
  Amazing. Incredible. Awesome. Action movie like we've never seen before. Great visual effects and great action sequences. Acting is spot on.
  What this movie lacks in plot it makes up in visual brilliance. It doesn't waste time with lengthy or clunky exposition. This movie goes right into the action and proves that lives sets will always be better than an overdose of CGI. It's hard to tell if this is a sequel or a reboot but by the end of the movie I assure you, you won't care either way. Watching this movie in HD/4k Ultra is like putting on a nice pair of glasses for the first time and the soundtrack is just as epic. This is a movie where you eat popcorn and let the movie overload your senses.
  It wasnt bad. I wish the end was more satisfying. I have some gripes about it for sure, and despite what just about everyone said, I do think it helps to have seen the originals.
  Best choice for the first Color movie!!!
  I loved this movie. This is exactly why I try never to read reviews. It was a modern twist on King Arthur and I am bummed that they will probably not make a sequel on account of "reviews".
  Always a delight no matter what age!
  Surprisingly good, even with some of the anachronisms & Richies signature swagger. It is astonishingly faithful to the source material while feeling free to riff on the myth in fresh ways, & it's a classic example of the hero's journey. Bravo!
  Woodrow is a consistent four-star filmmaker, but he really missed the mark with this one. Given all his recent trouble with the #metoo movement, this really doesn't look good for him; Kate Winslet's Ginny is a cold, unsympathetic, uncompromising madwoman. The most sympathetic, moral character is her abusive husband Humpty; not a good time for Allen to share these kinds of complicated character dynamics. On a visual design level, it is among his finest works, only very little character substance to fill in the gorgeously lit space. I'm not exactly sure when shit hit the fan for Allen, but it legitimately looks like he just gave up making it - all along it's building towards Ginny's arc, which we never get. Despite the empathy we sense for an aging woman's sexuality, nothing about her depiction seems very poignant. It seemed promising at first; a cross war of each other's respective children, Humpty unable to stand her son's mischief, Ginny jealous over his daughter's relationship with the young man she's been having an affair with. But Winslet's ferocity is almost too much at times. At first you want to see her have that arc, but she goes overboard when she makes a key decision later in the film. We get our emotions held up in the belief that she will have that arc, reaching across to her step-daughter with love, protecting her from the danger she's in. But as Mickey's friend says earlier, "you're not dealing with sense, you're dealing with feelings." That's a fact for everyone in the film, no sensibility anywhere. I guess Allen is trying to make a point with that in the 1950s, but something about it just seems too unbelievable. There is this ridiculous moment when Mickey goes to Ginny at her home, having concluded what happened to her step-daughter by an absurd estimation of facts as if he were TV's OCD detective Monk. He follows this with, "it doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to figure out..." I laughed, thinking, gees, it really kind of does take Holmes to figure that out!The film ends just as we're anticipating the next act, which never comes.
  So they toke Christmas back by working harder overnight and men did not help at all. Great job
  Brilliant and classic, incredibly quotable and iconic.
  We though this was typical guy Richie style and loved it. Great cast. Well done!
  This is a timeless movie... hard not to give it a great rating.
  Intense. And wonderfully acted and directed
  Nope. The video game had a more memorable plot.
  Great kid movie and plot . Enjoyed watching it with my 7 and 9 yr olds. Pleasantly surprised to see Rob Lowe and Danny Glover in it.
  I'm sorry but this is not worthy of an Oscar let alone best picture. Slow, boring and uninteresting. I'm not being harsh this film does not stand up to others that have achieved its accolades, not even close.
  Full of intensity but that's about allThere was.
  A movie is more than a movieMOONLIGHTHum... it's always ungrateful for someone to write about something they don't quite understand. This week I've watched Renoir, Goddard and now Jenkins and I left each movie knowing less about film as I did walking in (though I despise Goddard). In all truth, a good movie should challenge what you believe and question your perception. So it's always emotionally tasking to rate a film that rings so personal to you, as when you critique it, you can't help to pick it apart. Moonlight is a coming of age story shot perfectly, this is where you see a director's vision coming through. As we follow Chiron as he goes from little to grown up we understand gradually more about his mind and personality. We see, before our eyes, the character evolving and changing in ways that Boyhood never quite acomplishes, for example. Chiron is played beautiful by the three actors who have equal meritt in portraying him in a way we don't stop feeling his essence. Future Oscar winner Mahershela Ali is a knock out alongside Janelle Monae but enough praise can't be given to Naomie Harris who, after the crapfest Collateral Beauty, gives a complex and enthralling portrayal of a drug adict. The soundtrack is one of the most perfect (if not the most) of the year, it grips you, haunts you and it complements the movie with grace. The cinematography is a perfect fit for Jenkin's direction - with expressive use of depth of focus and and the shifting of focal points beyond what's obvious. Also, the use of color cannot be understated, with one of the best deliveries of color mainly through light cinema has ever seen. The only thing I'd rule against is its overuse of flares, which is a matter of personal taste more than anything. Overall, the cinematography is a extremely lenghty home run, Jekins can make wiping jizz in the sand seem beautiful. Structurally is flawless and its editing and script are two feats of filmmaking. I'd argue that it looses steam in the third act and the end could have been worked on, yet I can't say many more cons. In the end, the subject matter hit me hard as I could see myself in many ways in Chiron. Watching him try to come to terms with his homossexuality and being bullied are things that didn't happen to me but could easily have. Most moments in first two acts seem like a succession of blows that brought me to tears and caused me to be on the edge of my seat. I don't remeber a recent time when I rooted so much for a character. It's a heartrenching movie that all should see. It's these kind of films that the Academy should recognize! This film is why I go to the movies!
  this is not ghost in the shell
  A MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  The film assembles its character portrait of woe very well and very efficiently, with Jenkins and his cinematographer James Laxton showing a love for moving their camera through busy scenes in a single take. Yet Chiron's journey becomes slowly overwhelmed by the film's swelling sense of self-importance. We're meant to read great profundity into every pregnant pause and depressing turn, as though the issues of troubled black urban youths are being raised on film for the first time. It becomes very tedious very quickly. And, frankly, "Moonlight" simply runs out of puff, with too little in the film's final chapter to drive it home to a closure that is dramatically satisfying. While "La La Land" isn't the pinnacle of originality, obviously, "Moonlight" felt unoriginal and at times pretentious. Not the Best Picture.
  whitewashing aside, and without knowing that much about the anime, this was a fun movie, with good effects and good acting. Would have been nice to have at least seen more asian supporting actors to help the void of asian A list actors in hollywood to avoid future whitewashing.
  An allegorical rendering? WTF? Who IS the Tin man? I don't trust the bitch either! A whopping two thumbs up... MY ASS!
  Felix has been pestering me to watch this film every weekend so it's no great surprise that he was engrossed throughout. This literally is a film about Trucks with Monsters in them (nice ones though!). I found ti watchable enough even if the central character is a bit of a twat. Steals wholesale from a lot of better movies like E.T. but not a bad Daddy/Son offering.
  "The Wizard of Oz" will be a class in everyones eyes forever, bringing the light of day into the world of film and putting a smile on anyones face. As Dorothy dreams a dream that is unlike anything on earth, she creates a story that is one of the most brilliant telling in the history of film. I absolutely love this movie from start to finish. From it's clever dialogue, to it's hilarious acting, to the true heart of the story, this film surpasses any film of it's kind. Easily one of my favourites. New techniques and editing, the directors of this film (Victor Fleming and King Vidor) make it a wonder to behold! Absolutely stunning filmmaking!
  You gotta be fuckin' shitting me. 97% score? This movie was so fuckin' retarded. It was nothing a but a 2 hour car chase. You guys don't know shit about movies.
  this was really emotional and sometimes hard to watch, but it's so beautiful in such an original way. There's so much to learn just by watching this. the performances were great. the more I think about it, the more I think this is a film I'll remember for a long time.
  Awesome car chasing/ action movie. Violent, sexy and so much fun to watch. Highlights all the time.
  Amazing picture. I never knew I wanted it but here it is. Just go watch it.
  y does everyone make a big fuss about this movie?it's crap
  I guess I'm the only person on the planet who didn't like this movie. Dorothy and her incessant whining got on my nerves.
  Very well put together story of a black man growing up gay in Miami. Great acting pulling you into the drama of the interactions he had with peers and the help he received from a couple who became surrogate parents.
  I absolutely love Kig Arthur : Legend of the Sword. The acting is wonderful and King Arthur ( Charles Hunnan) and The Mage ( Astrid Berges Frisbey are a fantastic team. She is French and I believe he is from Australia. Love them both.The supporting actors were fantastic as well. THE STORY. WOW. Whomever wrote, directed and starred in this movie should be awarded the Acadamy Award, that is how much I love this movie. Let' us not forget Jude Law who plays the part of an evil King with powers given to him by the dark side who is represented my very large snake creature. This creature is hideous and beautiful but very evil just the same. Jude Law played his part with such perfection that it is possible that you may hate him after seeing this movie. Remember people, only the character he plays is evil, not him.  I taped in on my DVR just by accident but I will tell you, it was the best accident that has ever happened to me.  Rent the Movie ! You will be fascinated, angry, sad, happy and all the emotions these wonderful actors bring you through. Watch it at least two times so you don't miss a thing.  I heard there is a follow up movie and I will be waiting. Love to All, Cathy. catshabay
  like this best never mysterious the wizard of oz no was l.frank baum
  good movie... next read the comic
  So Funny! This one was so much more funnier than the first.Lots of cussing and nasty talk, so I wouldn?t bring kids.
  Outdated. I know it was incredible in the 30's but nothing in this overrated film has held up. And the hype kills it.
  It's only good for the nostalgia. Does not stand the test of time at all.
  Surprisingly, I THOROUGHLY enjoyed it... It was both funny and action-packed.
  I was always interested in fantasy movies and after watching this one is become truly my favorite. even tho I watched quite late,in ate age of 25. The Wizard of Oz is a timeless classic and I just loved it.The story is about Judy Garland who plays Dorothy traveling to the land of Oz and meets with Lion and the Scarecrow with who she has plenty of adventures and to battle the forces of evil.This is kind of film which can be enjoyed by everyone regardless of their age.
  Moonlight is one of the heart touching movies I have ever seen. Its simple and beautifully written.
  A bit of a guilty pleasure. This Scarlett Johannsen vehicle does take a while to get going, and it's just a wee bit too dark lighting wise, but the story starts kickinh in, and it gets really interesting. Plus this is a visual design marvel.
  Fair movie at best. Unworthy of a rewatch
  How could you not be captivated and engrossed by this movie that changed filmmaking forever? This movie goes far and beyond your wildest dreams. Even for 1939, this movie changed everything I know about movies and the way films are perceived today.
  So exciting and action-packed
  I love the wizard of oz .
  A life in three acts. The first chronicling a bullied child who is mentored by a charismatic drug dealer. The second act details his struggles with bullies and emerging sexuality. Followed by the final act which is a glimpse of him as a young man. Fantastic performances, beautiful cinematography, and well-written dialogue. This is as good as it gets.
  I love the world Dir George Miller created, it was visually stunning for a deserted apocalyptic world that was very much dead and barren, making it hauntingly beautiful. Besides the visual aspects, the characters and dynamics of the world were intriguing and although they were other-worldy it was very much reflective of our own making this movie so much more than a typical apocalypse action film/
  An absolute spectacle!
  Plot was too predictable and boring. The dialogues, when there were any, were below average with nothing memorable or to give food for though. All in all a waste of time in my opinion.
  if u have kids its great for them.!
  Horroble, boring movie
  A beautiful film that portrays a much needed story in today's society that is still quite overhyped. Felt far too short considering the subject matter and story plays it a little loose & safe. Wish it just offered..... more.
  The fantastic visuals ruined by half baked story line and worst still, totally re-writing the characters. This feels more like a rip off from the original 1995 movie then and adaptation. It's pretty obvious the movie producers don't understand what the anime was about...
  Tom Hardy filmed movie in 20 words...
