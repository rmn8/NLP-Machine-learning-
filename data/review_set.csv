"  Colorful movie, love it!",5
  Please consider never talking to me about movies if you dont like this movie. Classic,5
"  One of the best movies of its kind, I gotta say 99 rotten tomatoes, this movie should go up to 100% rotten tomatos to me!",5
"  A real classic. Although unrealistic I loved it, it was the first ever color film, it had a good storyline, a good cast, good directors and good special effects (of course, the effects are bad now, but at the time they were very good). Highly recommend. Everyone should see this movie at least once in a lifetime",4
  I love the wizard of oz so much. The wizard of oz is my favorite movie ever. I've had a lot of great fond memories watching the wizard of oz a lot back when I was a very small baby and a little kid. It is definitely my favorite movie period. It is one movie that has lived on for many of years since it first came out. And it's characters and the cast still look great as they were back in 1939. Movies like this one has a very soft spot in my heart and I've always related to this movie. I'm pretty sure of all the classic films that came out after 1939 you kind of compare them to the wizard of oz and I don't think the wizard of oz has been beat. It is one of those classic movies that has lived on for generations after generation. I really love the songs in the film which they are called musical numbers. My favorite musical number out of all the songs in the movie is the scarecrows song if i only had a brain. Judy garland and Ray bolger were great in the wizard of oz. They fit the characters that they played.,5
"  I want to vomit every time I come by this movie, even as a child I hated this movie.",0
  A classic piece of cinematic beauty that will be cherished for years to come.,5
  a masterpiece..a classic..holds up to this day.,5
"  What is unbelievable is that the Wizard of Oz was made in 1939, the graphics in the movie are revolutionary and extraordinary. TWTO is way ahead of its time and it is one movie that would associate well with people even today.",5
  Timeless Masterpiece that can be enjoyed by all ages.,5
  gooooood filmmmmm yaaahhhh,5
"  Amazing movie, every scene is magic.Its hard to believe it was made in the 30's.",5
  Great movie to watch with your kids.,5
  favorite childhood movie!! =],4
  ??????????????????????,5
  Probably one of my favourite films ever. Definitely in my top ten.,4
  One of the best movie of early cinema.,4
"  One of the greatest showings of visual and audible elegance. This level of vibrance was almost unheard of in 1939, and yet The Wizard Of Oz was able to perfect it. A feat that movies in 2018 can not repeat. Perhaps the greatest movie of all time. 9.8/10",5
"  The Wizard of Oz is probably the first movie I truly fell in love with as a kid. I lived within sight of Kansas my entire childhood and the tornado scene struck a feeling of such primal fear in me as a kid it's hard to describe, particularly since I saw my first tornado at about 6 years old. The entire movie still resonates with me all these years later. It's timeless and classic in every sense. Beautiful sets, colors and costumes. Who cannot say that when Somewhere Over the Rainbow starts playing, it is bound to bring up some deep beautiful emotions every single time? The story, the characters, The Wizard of Oz has it all. I will never get tired of watching again and again.",5
  this movie should die already,0
"  Charming and cute, The Wizard of Oz impresses for a movie from the 30s,its clever script seemingly having barely aged.",4
"  there is no place like home..The Wizard Of OzIt is one of those cult classic features that happen to have everything in the right place; from characters to performance and from script to execution. The adaptation is short and smart that covers up every essential information and emotion from the novel and helps connect easily with the audience. Victor Flemming has done a decent work on executing the tale and it works for the major part of it because of his affection and passion towards conveying the right message. The performance is not outstanding but definitely admirable, especially when on creating comic sequences. The Wizard Of Oz not only works as a whole project, but score majestically on technical aspects too like costume design, production design, background score, choreography and songs that helps celebrate it on such large scale.",4
  This movie is an 8/10. Good movie but it in no way deserves a 99%. My biggest complaint is the acting. Everyone just seems to dumb like the movie doesnt take itself seriously.,4
  really boring almost fell asleep. would only recommend to old white people,1
"  tHIS IS AN EXCELLENT ALL AROUND MOVIE, IT CAN SCARE LITTLE KIDS, IT SURE DID ME MOST OF MY LIFE UNTIL I BECAME AN ADULT, IT'S JUST A GOOD SOLID MOVIE.",5
  Masterpiece! 10/10 5 ***** starsDon't make films like this anymoreI'm a 36 yr male and i love this film!Watching it in bed eating food ??,5
  A movie that can be watched over and over.,4
  The influence for many classics after,5
  A masterpiece that will never be forgotten.,4
"  The Wizard of Oz is one of the greatest films ever! It's extravagant colors and wonderful musical numbers, as well as Judy Garland, make it a classic film for all ages!",5
  Both witches die. It's all a dream. Midgets everywhere.,5
"  with a great performance from judy garland and with its outstanding use of technicolor, the wizard of oz is a must see film for both old and young. revolutionary in every sense, this film should top the list of the greatest films ever made.",5
  A timeless masterpiece. Just pure magic.,5
  Love it! Reminds me of my.mother! ?? always was her favorite movie!,0
  The single greatest movie of all time. Epic in every way.,5
"  A leading contender for Most Famous Movie In Cinematic History, The Wizard Of Oz is a harmonious blending of mega-popular songs, quotable lines, memorable characters and colourful scenery. The somewhat troubled production and many on-set difficulties never show on the screen, with everything happening in a whirlwind of childhood delight and endless whimsy. It plays more like a stage show or pantomime, with exaggerated performances and constant movement, and it suits the tone perfectly. You could pick holes in its plot and the logic of the Wicked Witch, who was a dumb villain before James Bond movies made it cool, but it doesn't matter. The Wizard Of Oz has resolutely stood the test of time, a symbol of the Golden Age of Hollywood, and all the magic and emotion that comes with such a label.",4
  The Best Family Movie Ever Made A Delight From Beginning To End!,5
  not good bad visuals and storytelling must not watch,0
"  One of the first kid's films ever is still among the sweetest and most entertaining. To this day, when Dorothy first enters Oz, a sense of awe overtakes the viewer, as we marvel at the pure perfection of the design and the splendid pacing of the adventure. Performances are wonderfully alive, songs are iconic and great, and the sincerity of heart is timeless.",5
  Did anyone else want to slap Glinda when she told Dorothy she had the power to go home all along?,2
  One of the best movies ever made.,5
  Still my favorite movie. The flying monkeys still scare the bejebus out of me. Margaret Hamilton is BRILL.,5
"  Still adore this movie, I dunno how many times I've watched it.",5
  One of the most timeless films ever made. 1001 movies to see before you die.,4
"  Freaky fantasy feature for frivolous fun. If the quirky dwarfs don't get to you, the droning film itself just might. Country bumpkin Dorothy and her weather-beaten house are lifted in a tornado only to land ""over the rainbow"" and right on top of a witch. Enter the ""munchkins"" (dwarves) who advise Dorothy to travel to the county's biggest city with a stupid scarecrow, an effeminate tin-man, and a slobbering lion (her ""friends""). Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing, Dorothy returns to her home and realizes that everything she could ever want in life is right there on her farm, except for a job, a car, and any opportunity to have something resembling an exciting life. Over-rated film; mostly for kids.",0
  Seen it ????????watch this movie ??,5
"  La película más protegida en la historia del cine...Realmente es necesario sugerir a los niños, jovenes y adultos ver esta película. Es parte de la cultura popular global (o al menos occidental) y a pesar de lo simple de la sinopsis y la divergencia entre el libreto y el libro original del señor Frank Baum, la sensación final es satisfactoria. No has visto cine verdadero si no has visto este filme.Lo más impresionante tanto para la gente que tuvo la bendición de ver la cinta en 1939 o en sus reestrenos como para aquellos que la vimos en DvD, es la transición del color sepia a el Technicolor. Es un momento mágico. La bella actríz Judy Garland es y será siempre Dorothy en la mente de muchos, a pesar de que su carrera tuvo apogeo fruto de otros filmes que protagonizó y que también son de mucho menester el tener que mirarlos, como por ejemplo Meet me in St. Louis. Los demás actores merecen mucho aprecio y si en el pasado no lo tuvieron como quizá hoy se sobrevalora a muchos actores de segunda de cualquier película de Disney, estoy seguro que cualquiera que vea esta película se encariñará con básicamente todo el elenco, incluso con Margaret Hamilton a pesar de su papel antagónico. Dicho aquello, alguien con sentido común puede disfrutar de la talla del elenco de la MGM en esos tiempos.La música del prólogo evoca muchas emociones agradables y la segunda vez que se escucha obligatoriamente eriza la piel. Descrito lo anterior, toda la banda sonora de la película es una obra maestra del cine. Si se comparara Mamma Mía como musical con el Mago de Oz, Mamma Mía es basura maloliente y el Mago de Oz es un mosaico de rubíes.Recomiendo verla en inglés aún si eres hispanohablante.La mejor frase del cine para mí sin duda es ""No place like home"" (No hay lugar como el hogar)La película es tan buena que nadie se atreve a realizar un remake...y así como la cinta original es una de las más protegidas del cine universal, debería de mantenerse el respeto a esta obra y obviar la idea de querer hacer una nueva versión. Existen otras claro pero exploran otros temas de la obra de Frank Baum o bien otros de sus libros del mundo de Oz.",5
"  ""There's no place like home"" - Kids during those era ans well as present deserves such moral to be thought in such be phenomenal way to be carried away through many ages. And I would always say in this flick the COSTUME plays a role of hero and the performance of the entire cast plays a role of HEROINE . I am so amazed with the fact which is undeniably true to admit that costumes can play spectacular role in absence of computer graphics. Each and every character paid just to their role and my special mention to Margaret Hamilton (wicked witch).Innocence of Dorothy had stolen the screen presence many time during the flick. Songs were overwhelming. Over all Mesmerizing picture with hued collections.",4
"  Everything about The Wizard of Oz is a sight to behold; the performances, effects, drama, story... all are of the highest quality of filmmaking and still impress even after nearly 80 years.",5
"  I know this movie was groundbreaking when this first came out, but I find myself bored because the music is too cheery. Too happy. The movie itself is too colorful. I have a bigger issue with Judy Garland's character because she's acting like she's in a melodrama. I actually hate this movie because I'm really bored. It's not engaging enough. I'm bored even writing this review on how much I'm bored even watching the movie.",1
"  Puntaje Original: 7.5Encantadora y divertida, con un icónico uso de la narrativa y el color, para dar un resultado más que maravilloso.",4
"  Overly campy, this film shouldn't be on your watchlist.",0
"  This charming movie is one of the best materpieces ever. With a solid cast, original and creative story, The Wizard of Oz brings to us one of the most original and funny musicals ever.",4
"  One of my all time favorite movies, maybe my all time favorite. Can instantly make me smile even on my worst of days. Just like in the movie itself you are transported to magical place when watching it. Judy Garland is perfect casting, but so many other incredible performances and musical numbers. Have never had the chance to see it on the big screen, would love to able to do that one day.",5
"  The Wizard Of Oz is one of my favourite movies of all time, and 78 years on, it hasn't out dated one bit. I love Judy Garland performance as Dorothy Gale, i love the adventures of the group in OZ, i loved the Wicked Witch, but she used to scare me as a child. Overall The Wizard Of Oz will always be a movie to go down in history",5
  If you don't love this movie your dead inside!,5
  I'm fairly certain this movie sits in its own wing of the Library of Congress under the title of: Greatest Movie ever made and Pinnacle of American Film making.,5
"  The Wizard Of Oz:The Wizard Of Oz's Groundbreaking special effects, classic dialogue, ageless musical numbers and a absolutely beautiful world makes The Wizard Of Oz one of the most influential movies ever made in cinema.",5
  Excellent acting on all levels with the best special effects for the period.,5
"  Why is this movie at 99%? i know its meant for little kids, but there is way better movies like cars, zootopia, finding dory, etc",0
"  This movie is a classic movie for my childhood, but I really love this movie so much",5
"  Great movie, one of my all time favorites, mesmerizing",5
"  Perfect Christmas viewing, fantastic film which i never tire of seeing. Christmas doesn't start till i have watched this.",5
  Not a fan of this movie,1
"  This is the one of my best childhood memories about movies that I'll remember forever.I don't remember when exactly I watch it, but I do remember that time, when I was a child, I imagining myself as Dorothy, in Munchkinland in the Land of Oz, Glinda tells me to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City, where the Wizard of Oz might be able to help to get back home. Then on the trip, meets and befriends with a Scarecrow (who wants a brain), a Tin Man (who desires a heart), and a Cowardly Lion (who is in need of courage).Yeah. When I was younger, though I still do this until today, I often used to put myself as a character inside of a story, either in the books or in the movie. Well not all, depends on the character itself. If I can relate to the character, even the slightest, then I do. If I can't, I separate myself from the character and look at it from an outside source, or I'll be the side character (not main character) if I'm more relate to them.I'm pretty sure this ever happened to you too. Am I right? So if you haven't watched this movie, go watch it!! especially for classics movie lovers.P.S: what I do remember too is that I'm freaking happy when I finally found this movie these days. and I'm watching it again and relive my childhood memories all over again.",5
"  Puntaje Original: 7.5Encantadora y divertida, con un icónico uso de la narrativa y el color, para dar un resultado más que maravilloso.",4
"  A timeless classic, the wizard of Oz is a wacky, fun and imaginative adventure that is sure to last for generations to come.",5
  i. like. this. movie,5
  For almost seventy-six years people have gone over the rainbow and been off to see the wizard. No reason to stop now!,5
"  My childhood in a nutshell. The colors, the themes, the hilarious characters, the childlike imagination of the story, what's not to love. It's timeless and beautiful and pretty much the essential film to show a kid.",4
  Why does this exist.,0
"  How Can you not love this movie, Best of all time. Watch it even tho i'm 56 and still love watching it A+++++",5
"  Easy to see why this amazing achievement was rated the #1 fantasy movie of all time. Perfect casting and visuals decades ahead of its time, no movie of any genre has ever pushed the envelope so far in one fell swoop. Pure Magic.",5
  Great film. Complete classic. Never gets old. Timeless music.,5
"  The Wizard of Oz (1939) is as visually exciting and emotionally stirring today as it was when first released. It's the ultimate family film. A wonderful cast and score bring the magical characters and story to life, as the audience is swept away on Dorothy's journey over the rainbow. Every turn on the yellow brick road is packed with creativity and whimsy that plucks at the heartstrings. The cinematography is just perfect. Judy Garland emanates a delightful innocence as Dorothy that perfectly matches the film's tone, and the Wicked Witch of the West is the quintessential fantasy villain. The Wizard of Oz deftly embeds moral messages into its enchanting story, allowing its audience to fully join Dorothy on her journey of awakening. The film is still firmly stamped into contemporary popular culture - the best evidence that it will forever endure the test of time. The Wizard of Oz (1939) is morally, ethically, spiritually, physically, positively, absolutely and reliably wonderful.",5
  My Favorite Film Is 1941's Citizen Kane.,0
"  A visually dazzling ride for its time, this family classic also has enough humor, memorable characters and joyful music to endure the ages, even if its dramatic acting would be considered abysmal today.",4
"  This movie might be creative, but it's not interesting at all, it is made for kids 8 and younger, the plot's cheesy, the acting's cheesy, and yes it was in the 1930's, but that's no excuse for how cheesy this crap is. The only other people who might like are college dropouts, high on cough syrup.",0
"  An enchanting classic fantasy film with strong performances from Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, and Margret Hamilton within a larger cast.",4
  I grew up watching this movie and I love it but I wish it would have been closer to the original story,4
  When I was younger I watched this movie and it was not the best movie I thought it's just to old fashioned movie that's how I felt about it. And why did critics give it 99% I say no,2
"  Greatest movie ever made, there will never be another one like it. Released at perfect time and so innocent yet telling for its day. The end of the depression and loss of innocence going into WWII.",5
"  Timeless classic! The Wizard of Oz has great music, comedy, and storytelling. I also grew up with this movie so the nostalgia comes every time I watch it.",5
"  Oz é um clássico do cinema, quanto a isso não há duvidas, e possui vários motivos para isso, porém como resultado final The Wizard of Oz é pediocre. A fabula criada por L. Frank Baum não evolui como roteiro nas mãos de Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson e Edgar Allan Woolf, apesar da estrutura técnica disposta pela MGM na época o filme parece uma grande loucura com temas infantis.",0
"  A wonderful movie with lovely, iconic visuals.",4
  This is my all time favorite movie. The brilliant works of Judy Garland and Margaret Hamilton are simply brilliant. It is a must see classic.,4
"  Tough to find a film that's more universally recognized and adored than this one, and with good reason. It's charming and quaint, relic of a bygone era where naivete was a-okay and being earnest wasn't seen as a handicap. Loaded with unforgettable lines and classic songs, nothing feels elbowed-in or insignificant, and I say that as a viewer with very little patience for musical interludes. Sometimes it's nice to just climb into that time capsule and relive your own childhood (as I have to think a vast majority of the current population first saw it at that age), but it also serves as an impressive example of thoughtful, creative filmmaking. The famous mid-scene switch from sepia tones to full-blown Technicolor remains especially stunning, a masterful reveal that immediately brings the land of Oz to life with a roar, and the intense, colorful landscapes that light up every scene never let up. A few seams may show here and there, particularly around the matte paintings in recent HD transfers, but in some ways that works to the film's benefit. Clearly, a tremendous amount of love and care went into this one, and that still radiates as warmly today as it did almost eighty years ago. Well-balanced, evenly paced and visually dazzling, it's aged stupendously and stands tall as a cornerstone of family cinema. My kids loved it, though they weren't as petrified of the flying monkeys as I was at their age, and I loved sharing it with them. Surprised to find I still enjoy this as much as I do.",4
  The most iconic film of all time.,5
"  stunning, the best film ever",5
"  Some munchkins were not particularly good actors. ""King of the Forest"" is not particularly catchy. I saw some lip sync issues. Okay, got that out of my system. This is still one of my all time favourite movies. A dazzling landscape that pops out in a uniquely early technicolour fashion (filming in colour with the appropriate colours would likely dazzle less), songs and lines that are short and brisk enough to stick in the memory and still resonate beyond culture beating them to death, acting that brings so much humanity to the fantastical story (especially Judy Garland), and the story. Phew. I do not recommend facing The Wizard of Oz as a direct political allegory; save that for the original book. Still, some comparisons are out there in the open. Look at Scarecrow. He don't know any better than to remain on his farm, but if he had a brain, he would know what to do with it. The Wizard is all bark and no bite, unlike Toto, but under the shroud of his chamber, he can pose as a fearless, uncompromising leader. Dorothy would love to see a world other than what she has known for her life, but she feels beholden to her family and friends, thus feels content in the subpar lifestyle of rural Kansas. Heavy-handed, does this sound? Think again. This film moves quickly and with a hop at every step. The actors are highly committed to their roles. And it's so funny. The Cowardly Lion is perhaps my favourite movie character to impersonate, in how quickly he drops a dime from snarls to weeping. As the story unfolds, you will notice many familiar tropes in storytelling. ""Only bad witches are ugly?"" Eek. And yet, no matter how tired you might have been of them, The Wizard of Oz takes you on such a whimsical, hopeful adventure in hardly any time at all. It is shockingly ageless.",5
"  You can see the template for Star Wars and a hundred other movies in this justly-lauded classic, but even after a million viewings it's the heart and sentiment that catch you, especially knowing that it was released at the beginning of the 2nd World War, when home and family were so important, and courage, heart and thought pre-eminent. A marvellous journey every time.",4
  The widzard of Oz is one hell of movie one hell of a movie !! When doerothy fall down the stairs is the key to the movie !!! But sometimes they don't !! I favorite part is when the witch melt into plastic!!! I don't like the movie !!!,5
  I hated classic old movies when I was a kid. All except this one. The perfect movie.,5
  The tin man is a fag,0
  How could someone not like this classic?,5
"  Sei que se trata de um dos maiores clássicos do cinema e que provavelmente o teria adorado em criança, mas vê-lo pela primeira vez em adulto, especialmente com a enorme expectativa da fama que tem e depois de ter lido o livro, fiquei desapontado. A qualidade, para algo de 1939, é excelente mas não deixa de ser uma história para crianças que, quanto a mim, carece de algum apelo a um público mais maduro como muitos modernos filmes infantis possuem.",2
"  An unforgettable classic, enough said!",5
"  This is a pretty okay movie, but it definitely wasn't the best movie of all time.",2
  One of those movies that everyone loves but nobody remembers.,5
"  Took me a long while to get around to watching it, but now I suddenly get where all sorts of cultural memes come from (Lions! And Tigers! And Bears! Oh my!).Spectacular for the era in which it was made, and it actually aged pretty well too. It's not perfect, having a few things that it never bothers to answer (for instance, what exactly is the Tin Man supposed to be? An automaton? And what about the woman who wants to put Toto down?), and it's obvious that they're trying to stretch the run time sometimes (e.g. all the singing by the Munchkins) but those are minor things and it's actually still enjoyable, and surprisingly not-cheesy, in fact not at all painful in any way really.Moreover, it was actually pretty clever, even if a bit simple. And even if it's not the best thing ever made, the status of a classic is well-earned for all of these reasons.I don't think I can say anything that anyone else hasn't said before, you all know the drill, blah blah classic blah blah watch it if you're a film buff.",4
"  You cannot hate this movie, or else you will not be accepted into society. I loved it so much that I bought the book (The Wonderful Wizard of Oz By L. Frank Baum) and read it millions of times. In fact, I am reading the entire series of the books.",5
"  Clearly one of the greatest film of all time, by any standard. This film has stood the test of time, and is no less fascinating and brilliant today than it was in 1939. This is the gold standard of children's films and has set the barre for the industry to come. Few films have come close to its perfect flow, soundtrack, acting, plot, directing, cinematography and special effects. The story-line is seamlessly tied together. It is incredible that the special effects are still as effective today as they were back in 1939, despite the age of this masterpiece. My young children enjoyed this film just as much as I have over the years.I'm glad Hollywood has not bastardized this film with a ""reboot"" - yet. The world does not need another horrible Tim Burton remake of a classic novel and/or film, as the modern treatment of Alice In Wonderland has demonstrated.Whoever is the 1 ""professional"" critic that posted a negative review of this film is a complete fool. They should be banned from this website and is certainly no professional from my perspective.",5
"  Conceived by MGM as an answer to Walt Disney's Snow White, this sweet and colorful fable full of music and adventure will always be a pleasure to children everywhere due to its relatable characters and universal message, though it may prove a bit slow for adults nowadays.",5
"  The simplistic story and characters can be surprisingly engaging, the songs are very memorable even to this day, the cinematography is really well-executed, and the effects are especially impressive by 1930s standards.",4
  Why not just hit the old woman in the mouth?,4
"  I give it 2 stars because its an iconic movie that broke barriers at the time. Otherwise, there is way too much whining from Dorothy. Shes in a wonderful, colorful land, and all she can do about it is complain about wanting to go home the whole time? It ruins the movie and bastardizes the book.",2
  Have you ever searched long and hard for something dear to you but just couldn't find out where you left it. Well that was the case in this loving American fantasy film. Waking up lost in Munchkin land Dorothy's goal was to return home. Not knowing that along her journey she would meet friends who would become near to her and they would need her help more than anything. Searching for things they already possess they prove to be braver smarter and more caring than they expected.,5
"  Groundbreaking in every single way. From its visuals, songs, to it's storytelling and touching heartfelt message. The Wizard Of Oz is a must see for all ages even if you didn't grow up with it it's still an iconic piece of filmmaking",5
  A classic! A must see for every child and those young at heart.,5
  I've seen it about 30 times. Love it!!!,5
  hi people and my name is lori selligman and i love the wizard of oz i have got a lot of collectibles but i would like too have more oz items from lori seligman,0
  The best movie ever made my favorite sense I first saw it,5
  despite the slightly anti climatic ending there is a reason why the wizard of oz is a classic. a truly magical film.,5
  WHY IS IT SO HARD TO MAKE A SIMPLE LIST ON HERE?>????,0
"  The Wizard of OzThe Wizard of Oz is, simply put, a masterpiece of its age. It is a wonderful kid's movie, but it will also entertain teenagers and grownups, especially cinephiles. With a ton of incredible sceneries, wonderful characters, funny and innovative costumes, and a beautiful plot about not only adventure, but also family and home, it makes a movie anyone can watch and enjoy.The protagonist in The Wizard of Oz is a little girl who is tired of the farm she is living in with her family. The farm looks like a very melancholy and dark place, and it seems as if no one has time for her. She is dreaming of a wonderful place, a happy place where she can be a kid. Shortly after this, she does get what she is wishing for, as she somehow after a storm ends up waking up in a fantasy world full of wonderful creatures and happy colors. She gets greeted as a hero, after unknowingly killing an evil witch during her crash landing into the world. Very soon she realizes how worried her mom must be after losing her daughter, and decides to somehow make it back home. This is how her adventure to meet the great and mystical Wizard of Oz begins. As she is making her way to meet the wizard we get to meet a ton of new, both evil and good, fairytale-like creatures, with very convincing and straight forward character traits. Her adventure gets very suspenseful as she and her newfound friends finally get to meet the highly spoken about Wizard of Oz, it gets unclear if she is actually going to make it home. But in the end they do figure things out, and she does make it back home to her family, where she feels like she actually belongs. A lot of the music we get to hear throughout her adventure are cleverly describing what is happening, and makes the film even more fun to watch. It also serves as some help for the younger audience to keep up with the story.Even though the film is almost 80 years old, the plot has not grown old the slightest, and even though the special effects do not hold up to today's standards (it was made in 1939, so we are going to have to accept it), they are still impressive considering what year the movie was made. As a watcher you look forward to seeing the next scenery, or how the next creature will be and look like. This makes the movie very enjoyable. This also helps with the pacing, as you are always looking forward to the next scene (a lot of older movies tends to be slow paced, and sometimes therefore boring for audience nowadays). The Wizard of Oz catches the essence of adventure, dreams and excitement. It is impossible not to smile as the creatures of this new exciting world sings songs about their newfound hero and what's awaiting her. It was a bliss watching this movie, a timeless classic! As it states in the beginning - ""Time has been powerless to put its kindly philosophy out of fashion""./Leonard",4

Movie magic as sweet girl (and kawaii dog) are swept away to mystical land of Oz where delight and friendliness at every turn is varnished by an evil witch. With the help of a Scarecrow, a Tin Woodman, and Lion, she can restore Oz to greatness, but she just wants to go back to her family. Super casting, legendary scoring . . . you just can't beat this film! ""Over the Rainbow"" number and Herbert Stothart's soaring music won richly deserved Academy Awards. Based on the L.

  All time classic. Good wholesome family movie.,5
  The bad witch is very bad and has very magical powers. I liked the movie because the Winky guards are silly and hilarious. The nice witch is really nice.,5
  This. Is. The. Best. Ever. Movie. To. Watch,0
  A must see fantasy adventure fun for everyone! Judy Garland was a delight!,5
  The film that followed the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs! The Wizard of Oz is fantastic with its unforgettable characters and beautiful visuals.,5
  if you haven't seen it then i feel sorry for you...,5
  The acting was honestly so terrible and it seemed like a character was crying or freaking out every three minutes. I didn't like the music and all the OTHER characters were more loud and obnoxious than whimsical. The plot was weak for most of the movie until the final fight scene between the witch and Dorothy. Was very bored while watching and wanted to turn it off after about 30 minutes to an hour. Will not watch again.,2
"  Wonderful musical numbers, innovative set pieces and a wise and magical narrative makes The Wizard of Oz a classic for all audiences.",5
  This movie should be considered one of the greatest movies of all time. This is a great classic and will be enjoyed by everyone for centuries to come. A+,5
"  Whimsical, fun and colorful.",4
"  Of course it has flaws, it was made 77 years ago! But it is a classic that still bears valuable lessons.",4
  I watch this every few years and find that I enjoy it immensely each time. It's as if it magically grows and changes along with me. . I recommend periodic viewing of it throughout your life.,5

"  A beautiful, memorable and memorizing masterpiece that has lasted throughout the ages and will continue to do so for generations to come.",5
"  I grew up watching this classic film on TV, and I could never get enough of it. The songs, the characters, and the adventure all work together perfectly. And of course there is a moral at the end and lessons to be learnt along the way. Considered one of the top 10 movies of all time, the top fantasy film of all time, one of the best musicals of all time, and featuring the top movie song of all time ""Over the Rainbow"". It is my favourite film of 1939. AAN 1001.",5
  it was such a high rating and i really really hoped rami would be in this. very disappointed.,0
"  Over-rated by Rotten tomatoes. Nothing was special about this and you give it 9.4/10 no!!!, my score 7/10",2
  One of the most classic amazing movies of all time,4
  one of the best of all time,5
  It won't let me watch full movie,1
"  My dad's grandma always loves this film so do I. Many people around the world consider this one of the greatest musicals in the history of Hollywood. I love this movie as a kid and as I got older I still love it just like the other movies that I really love. The acting is perfect, the cinematography is absolutley brilliant the producers did a fantasic job and the directing is top notch. 100% perfect! The opening is in B&W; and it follows the story of Dorothy played by Judy Garland and Toto. When the tornado flew the house up and when it came down the B&W; is gone so it changed into Colour. The B&W; only began in beginning to end, the colour is in the middle. The quotes are so memorable like ''There's no place like home.'', ''I'll get you, my pretty and your little dog, too!'' and ''Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.'' The songs are memorable too like Over the Rainbow, DIng-Dong! The Witch is Dead and many more. The Wicked Witch of the West is an evil villian who wants the ruby slippers from Dorothy. This is an absolute masterpiece, an absolute classic! People watched it billions of times and it never gets old. This is a critical acclaim for everyone much like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.",5
"  Well, it's one of the greatest family films of all-time, one of the greatest fantasy films of all time, and one of the greatest films in general of all time. Epic storytelling, groundbreaking visuals, and a stellar cast make this the unbeatable American fantasy of the 20th century.",5
"  Revolutionary on a technical standpoint and utterly timeless and endearing, this film will be treasured by children and adults alike for many generations to come.",5

  This is one of the best movies of all time!,4
  Love this classic movie,5
"  I suppose I don't have to tell anyone that ""The Wizard of Oz"" is a good movie. I can certainly say it's a truly great movie ... more so than I remembered. It had been many years since I had bothered to watch the film. It's a film I have generally taken for granted. It's really the pinnacle of studio craft. All of the mighty resources of the Hollywood studio system marshaled to turn out a near perfect bit of family entertainment.",5

"  What can i write about The Wizard of Oz, that has never been written before. This movie is almost 80 years old, and it has been loved for each and every year. This is probably the most watched movie of all american cinema. Every kid has at least watched it once, if not more.It has every basic component of a great kids movie, it has memorable songs, a great story line, fun characters, thrilling moments and light hearted moments.As a kid i was terrified by Miss Gulch and The Wicked Witch of the West beautifully portrayed by Margaret Hamilton. Recently i watched this movie again and ±12 years later that caracter still frightened me when she was riding up to the farm, with the suspenseful music in the background and her frown on her face.This was the first cinematic experience of realising movie had color, the beautiful transition from gradient black and white, to the colorful world of Oz is a magnificent cinematic milestone, and probably one of the most awe inspiring scenes in the film.This movie is great, we all know it, and we all love it, and it is still thriving ±80 years upon release.The Wizard of Oz is a childhood masterpiece.",5
  Classical adaptation of the book,4
"  87%Watched this on 21/2/16I never expected that I would like this film and I saw this with a lot of skepticism, but what it did to me was that it invoked a certain kind of nostalgia in me and reminded me of a time where Fantasy genre was my absolute favourite. Apart from some stupid musical numbers, this film did not have much flaws and many songs were after all good, yet redundant. The film has a string of likable characters like the three friends whom Dorothy find in the journey. The acting was genuinely good with Judy Garland as Dorothy standing out as Dorothy. Surprisingly I also found the few wits in this film to be rather sharp and likable rather than being repulsive (which was what I actually expected).",4
  A wonderful kid's movie. See it at the right time and it stays with you. But its artistry doesn't transport me.,0

"  There are some things that just never leave you. Some things are so constantly part of the world in which you inhabit that they remain just inside your mental vision, maybe on purpose. The Wizard of Oz is like that. It?s a comfort for most of us. Like a cuddly uncle who is full of wisdom and old world charm, Oz remains a part of the great tapestry of our lives and that might be because it came to most of us when we were children.Seeing the movie for the first time in a theater earlier this week reiterated my theory that The Wizard of Oz has been seen by more people than any other single motion picture, and the fact that it comes to most of us as children is probably the reason why. I first saw the movie, like most people alive today, on television. I remember that it came on once around, usually around Thanksgiving. Like Santa Claus, or my birthday, it was an annual treat, something I knew that I wouldn?t see again for another year.As I slip rapidly into middle age, the power of the movie still enchants me, and as I grow into what I hope is wisdom born of life experience, I have attempted to analyze why. What I have come up with is this: The Wizard of Oz is the rare movie that taps into the intricate experience of growing up. The dreams that Dorothy sings about mirror our yearnings as children. We identify with our hero, Dorothy. She imagines a bigger place where her problems don?t linger and she is free to explore them. She sees the rainbow as her golden gate to a better place because in her drab sepia-tone Kansas world, the rainbow is the only source of color that she knows. She dreams of a bigger place and imagines a world where troubles melt like lemon drops. Who can?t relate?The movie works because it represents the colorful palette of our imagination but for Dorothy it is also a place where she does some growing up. The three friends that she meets along the way, The Scarecrow, The Tin Man and The Lion are emblematic of the lessons of bravery, love and devotion and the ability to think for ourselves ? and one of the hidden messages is that while the three are looking for these inner values, we can see clearly that they are attribute that they already possess. The Tin Man is an emotional being who cares dearly about his friends. Scarecrow, despite a perceived lack of intelligence, is the one who is always coming up with ideas that get his friends out of a jam. And the lion, cowardly though he may be, has an inner strength.The Wicked Witch of the West certainly represents the real dangers along the way. For Dorothy there is a motherly figure, Glenda the Good Witch who intends for Dorothy to discover for herself how to solve her problems. In a way, she seems to represent the parent that Dorothy doesn?t have back in Kansas. Her elderly aunt and uncle love her but this was 1939, in the midst of the depression and we imagine the climate that they live in, where work means keeping the farm. No work = no farm = no home.For 1939, Dorothy was the perfect character for young girls. She echoes many of the small town country girls who, in the midst of the depression, packed their suitcases and ran to Hollywood seeking fame and fortune in the movies. For them, this film is a cautionary tale that they?d be better off if they just stayed home. Judy Garland was perfect in the role, 17 at the time, but with wide-eyes and a beautiful, open face she carries that sense of wonderment of a child. Like most of us as children, her only true companion is a dog named Toto and the most frightening moment in the film is when she is nearly robbed of her best friend.When she sings ?Over the Rainbow? we know that it is a dream to escape an unhappy childhood (she has apparently lost her parents) and for Garland, we identify. She began in show business as a kiddie act with her sisters and began her long movie career when she was only 13. She was already a familiar face from Love Finds Andy Hardy and by the time of Oz, she was already under contract to MGM. That she was familiar to audiences helped her in the role. That familiarity works well with her ability to project the vulnerability and melancholy that the character needs. We have to believe that she will become frightened and that her life will be in danger, because if we sense that she can work her way out of the situation, then our interest wanes.If movies are a time capsule, then The Wizard of Oz wonderfully captures a brief moment of happiness in Garland?s life. We know of her problems with studio executives who put her through an exhausting schedule, using drugs to get her going in the morning, then again to put her to sleep at night. We know the legends of her mental and physical problems that dogged her most of her life, but The Wizard of Oz sees her at a moment in her life when it all seemed perfect, just as her star was rising and before her problems really began. There is poignancy in that, and that?s why the casting of Shirley Temple in the role would have been a mistake. By 1939, Temple was the biggest star in the world and her presence in the film would have been too much. She would have stood out and we would only seen Shirley Temple, not Dorothy Gale. Garland?s presence allows the story credibility. If you try and imagine that famous dance down the Yellow Brick Road with a 4 foot child and it just doesn?t fit. This is a movie in which all the pieces come together perfectly.What generosity these filmmakers had. What ingenuity to create this entire world that is colorful and beautiful and scary. What depth of character they created. What messages they send. This is a movie constructed with loving care. We?re told that those who worked on the film thought of this as just another movie, but that?s hard to believe. Certainly from the screenwriters you wonder if they saw how brilliantly they were tapping our frustrations and our excitement, our dreams, our need and our sense of wonderment. Did they know the impact of what they were working on, that the lovely sentiments that they created would still resonate 75 years later. Did they know that their heart?s desires weren?t that far from our own.",0
  lo que tiene the wizard of oz es una gran produccion para ser 1939,4
  So great and utterly fantastic. Revolutionary!,4
  The greatest fantasy movie ever made.,5
"  I remember watching it with my family. We all enjoyed it, both kids and parents.",4
"  I once dated a woman who revealed that she had never seen this movie. Naturally, I was quite surprised since The Wizard of Oz is considered so essential that it's practically unavoidable. It seems a bit silly to review a movie that almost everyone has seen, but I really do love it. The songs, the lavish sets, the colorful costumes, the hammy acting, and the wondrous score all are a delight no matter how many times one sees this picture.",5
  It's only good for the nostalgia. Does not stand the test of time at all.,1
"  A sweet and adventurous fable that arrests you with its loveliness and inescapable charm. Potentially the most beautiful movie ever made.How could anyone have known that Victor Fleming would change cinema forever with two films in the same year? Not only did he set a whole new standard for how epic films are made with ""Gone with the Wind"" but he also shaped the future of movies forever with this impeccable work of art. No question, ""The Wizard of Oz"" is a total masterpiece.",5
"  THE ""absolute masterpiece"".",5
  I just hate this movie.,1
  A fantasy musical that ruled it all in the late 1930s.,5
"  While today's kids may find this boring, film fans and the general audience alike will find this film full of heart and not without a brain. AND WHOEVER THAT ONE PERSON IS THAT MADE THIS 99%, GO SEE THE WIZARD AND DIE. :D",4
  Nothing compares and nothing can compete with how much this film has set as a standard for family fantasy films. It continues to be the best almost 80 years later.,5
"  Even though it is sort of namby-pamby and doesn't even come CLOSE to portraying the real Oz, it is fun and atmospheric, and the actors are great. The twister FX are good even by today's standards, and the story goes along fine without any problems. Margaret Hamilton still scares me today at 21 as the Wicked Witch. A classic. But the sequel is better.",5
"  I was always interested in fantasy movies and after watching this one is become truly my favorite. even tho I watched quite late,in ate age of 25. The Wizard of Oz is a timeless classic and I just loved it.The story is about Judy Garland who plays Dorothy traveling to the land of Oz and meets with Lion and the Scarecrow with who she has plenty of adventures and to battle the forces of evil.This is kind of film which can be enjoyed by everyone regardless of their age.",5
  Classic! A must see movie for all film lovers.,5

"  The Wizard of Oz is a wonderful movie that deserved to be a classic! The Wizard of Oz is a delightful treat for everyone of all ages! Everything I have seen in this movie is amazing! It has magic the whole family will enjoy. The movie is filled with great performances, music and songs.A tale from L. frank Baum, The Wizard of Oz tells the story of Dorothy, (played by a legendary Judy Garland), a young farm girl who live in Kansas. One day, an earthquake appears and takes Dorothy and her dog, Toto to the magical world of Oz, a place filled with pure imagination. While in Oz, she meets the Wicked Witch of the West, who really loves those red ruby shoes she has on. While she tries avoiding the witch, the nice creatures and people in Oz tell her to follow the yellow brick road. While walking, she meets a scarecrow, a tin man, and a lion. They all wish that had something that would be so special to them, The Scarecrow wishes for a brain, The Tin Man wishes for a Heart, and The Lion wishes for Courage, but Dorothy has the biggest wish of them all, to get back home to Kansas. They all must go see the Wonderful a Wizard of Oz which leads them to an adventure filled with creatures, weird people, and the Witch. The Wizard of Oz is a beloved classic for everyone. The songs are great, the music is wonderful, the screenplay is magnificent, the acting is fantastic, and the effects are really well done. The art direction is fantastically beautiful, the costume design is amazing, and the adventure in the movie triumphs! I think this should have won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1939.",5
  Simply the best version of The Wizard of Oz every made a true classic,5

  brilliantly classic! miss,5
"  The book felt more exciting to me reading it as a child. The movie is a magical classic for sure but watching it now, the acting and all seem a tad bit silly.",2
"  This movie is a classic! As a kid, i would sing along to all the songs. My favorite was when Glenda arrived in Munchkin land. And the tornado scene always scared me for some reason. I love the tin man. He's my favorite. And the witch. I love her! I remember when my school did a play of this, it brought back memories!",5
  This movie this creeps me right out.,1
"  This movie is a bare necessity of life, I grew up with this movie but neither of my parents where alive when it came out. This movie defiantly makes my top ten list for best movies of all time.",5
  Looove this movie. BTW The Wizard of OZ came out in 1939 not 33. Your a movie reviewing site you should know this.,5
  It's a classic and the top-rated film. There is no question.,5
  I'm not a fan of musicals... but for this I make an exception.,5
"  At the time of the filming of this movie little did anyone know back then that they would become part of Hollywood history and little Judy Garland would go on to become the greatest entertainer of all time...the story is timeless and the movie even more so...the realisation that this was filmed all those years ago itself seems out of time and almost impossible given how up to date it all seems and modern even by today's standards...it's a marvel and marvellous...a timeless classic,starring one of the worlds greatest movie stars...it never dates,never tires and never disappoints...That's Magic !",5
  Timeless and new every time you see it. Let the nostalgia take over.,5
  I used to love this movie and watch it almost every day. This is a great classic featuring my favorite villain. It may seem stupid to some but for 1939 this was great. But i don't like the ending though and it can get a tad to preschooly especially in the songs but in general it is one of my favorite classics.,4
"  Very cheerful and magical. It should be mandatory that every child watch this movie at least once. Coming back to it when you're older is like re-visiting an imaginary friend from your childhood. When I first watched it I was so young I had no idea what was going on, but to a child the movie is like meeting a colorful and non-threatening adult. A strange person who doesn't feel like a stranger.",5
"  I love watching the classics and actually seeing every reason it's a classic in the first place. Some classics make me question the sanity of the people who made them, but luckily The Wizard of Oz deserves its title.No need for an extensive review, honestly. Everything was great. The performances were wonderful, the story was brilliantly adapted, and the music was just delightful. So many iconic images, moments, and words, a whimsical fantasy land, special effects (COLOR!) that had audiences in 1939 screaming and cheering. Such a fun watch, I can't get over it. I highly recommend you let yourself experience this beautiful film. I can't wait to watch it with my grandkids someday. 10/10 Bye love you",5
"  Starring Judy Garland, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, Bert Lehr and Frank Morgan. Superb fantasy from L. Frank Baum's ""Oz"" stories, this film has withstood the test of time by the strength of its performances, unforgettable music (including Garland signature ""Over the Rainbow""), and its still dazzilling special effects. A delightful way to spend an evening. Directed by Victor Fleming.",5
"  I remember watching this film almost every year as a child. To me it defined the magic of cinema. I still love watching it. The players, music, direction and production make many of today's efforts look weak in comparison.",5
  My favorite movie of all. I have loved this movie for years. Watched it annually every Easter for many years.,5
  a classic simply stunning a great flim,5
  The best actor in the whole movie was the dog who played Toto.,1
"  I've called a few films 'timeless', but no other movie fits this description than 'The Wizard of Oz'. It is almost an unspoken law that parents must carry on the tradition of passing down this movie to their children and hopefully this will continue as long as the art of film is relevant.",5
  My favorite feature film ever.,5
"  I just don't get musicals, I don't know why I keep trying. It's not that this is a bad film it's just I don't find people skipping along singing songs with smug, knowing lyrics interesting. Dorothy's 3 accomplices I found all annoying plus why does Dorothy look like a prostitute dressed up as a little girl? Why is the good witch of the East about 76? It's not for me, sorry. 2 stars just because Judy Garland singing 'Somewhere Over The Rainbow' is spot on breathtaking though.",2
  What can I say about Judy Garland' s Wizard of Oz? Nothing except for beautiful!! Follow the yellow brick road!,5
  Grew up loving this movie. Nicely acted by the very diverse actors who play very diverse characters consisting of different subplots to entertain us while getting to the main plot's climax. A work of brilliance!,5
"  It may not be as cool as the movies of today, but this is definitely a must watch film.",4
  A classic impossible to match,5
  Novel. But did they botch the soundtrack?,2
  It's very good but it still terrifies me.,4
"  ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939)The Wizard of Oz is a classic 1939 American musical fantasy film produced by MGM and based of the 1900 novel ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" L. Frank Baum, although it wasn't the first film based on the novel. There was a film in 1910, 1925 and 1933 based on the Wizard of Oz. There was a film in 1908 that actually had a lot of involvement with L. Frank Baum and the film even had scenes in color. Sadly however, this film is lost and no copies of the movie are known to exist anymore. None of these films were ever as popular as the 1939 version directed by Victor Fleming and starring Judy Garland. Although the movie got good reviews, it was not a box office success getting only $3,017,000 on a $2,777,000 budget. At the time, it was the most expensive MGM film ever made and was a commercial flop. It however was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture which lost to ""Gone With The Wind"". It however won two awards including one for Best Original Song for ""Over the Rainbow"". Although the film was a commercial failure, when it was rebroadcast on television in 1956, it became a huge hit and has since become one of the most famous films ever made. Wizard of Oz is currently the most viewed motion picture in television history and is now seen as one of the greatest films of all time. There is so much to say about this film, but I guess the best place to start is at the beginning. Dorothy Gale (played by Judy Garland) is a farm girl who lives with her Aunt and Uncle on a farm in Kansas in the early 1900's. She decides to run away from home after a cruel neighbor had got a court order to take her dog Toto away. Dorothy however isn't that smart of a person, granted this is Kansas, but she is actually tricked by a phony fortune teller that her aunt is ill and encourages her to go back home. As Dorothy returns home, a powerful tornado comes and Dorothy is forced to take shelter in her home, but is knocked unconscious and wakes up to discover her house is being lifted up by the twister. She sees the woman who attempted to kill Toto who is Miss Gulch taken by the tornado and she transforms into the cackling Wicked Witch of the West on a broomstick. The farm house crash lands in the Wonderful Land of Oz in Munchkin Land. Although it wasn't the first film of its kind, it was one of the most famous classic films to be featured in color by Technicolor. The scenes in Kansas is filmed in black and white, whereas the land of Oz was filled in color and at the time, it was very rare to see a film in color, although Gone With The Wind, released that very same year was also in color. Dorothy is greeted by Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, and the Munchkins, who treat her like a hero because her house landed on the Wicked Witch of the East killing her as a result. Her sister, the Wicked Witch of the West, arrives and tries to claim the magical ruby slippers from her sister's feet, but Glinda transfers them to Dorothy's feet instead. The Wicked Witch of the West threatens Dorothy and her little dog too that she will get the Ruby Slippers back. Glinda tells Dorothy to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City where the Wizard of Oz might be able to help her get back home. Along the way she meets three new friends who also want to meet the Wizard. There's the Scarecrow who wants to have a brain, Tin Man who wants a heart, and the Cowardly Lion who wants courage. So the story is about Dorothy getting to the Wizard of Oz to get back to Kansas while being accompanied by her three friends and while avoiding the Wicked Witch of the West. *CAUTION SPOILER ALERT*I always thought this story made no sense. Why does Glinda have such disregard to Dorothy's safety? Giving her the slippers makes her the target of the Wicked Witch of the West and she tells her not to take them off. It's not like Dorothy asked for the slippers. Glinda also doesn't tell Dorothy that she can tap her heels to go home until at the very end after they arrive at Emerald City and after the Wizard of Oz failed to get Dorothy home. What was the point of all this? It makes no sense. But whatever, this movie is still a great classic**SPOILERS END HERE*There is so much to say about this wonderful classic. During the production of the film, Bubby Ebsen, the man who was originally cast to play as Tin Man, suffered an allergic reaction to the aluminum powder makeup he was wearing for his role, got sick and was unable to play the part and the film studio had to be shut down briefly until a new actor can fill the part. Although, some speculate that he refused to be painted silver and was fired. This however is unlikely since there were photographs of the actor wearing aluminum makeup, although no film footage of his scenes were ever released. Filming was even dangerous, Margaret Hamilton, the woman who played as Miss Gulch and the Wicked Witch of the West got severely burnt during one of the scenes and spent six weeks in the hospital before she returned for her role. The film is also noted for its musical selections and soundtrack, the most famous song is ""Over the Rainbow"" and that is considered to be one of the best original songs ever made for a motion picture. The film has since developed a lot of legends and even urban legends. One of which is if you play Pink Floyd's 1973 album ""The Dark Side of the Moon"" in its entirety starting at the beginning of the movie, it apparently syncs up to what is going on. The song ""The Great Gig In The Sky"" is played when the tornado strikes, the song ""Money"" is played right after Dorothy enters the Technicolor land of Oz (color film at the time was expensive), the song ""Brain Damage"" is played when the Scarecrow sings ""If Only I Had A Brain"" and the heartbeat at the end of ""Eclipse"" is played when Dorothy puts her ear to the Tin Man's chest (The Tin Man wanted a heart). Every member of Pink Floyd has since denied any connection saying whoever discovered this had way too much time on their hands. There was also a disturbing urban legend that a Munchkin can be seen committing suicide by hanging by the neck from behind a prop tree when Dorothy, the Scarecrow and the Tin Man are singing ""We're Off to See the Wizard"". The object however was actually a bird borrowed from the Los Angeles Zoo, most likely a crane or an emu that was placed on the indoor set to make it more lively. The most famous prop is the Ruby Slippers used for the film. Several were made, but only five are known to exist with one that was stolen and remains missing. One of the slippers was sold at an auction in 2000 for $666,000 making it one of the most valuable movie props of all time. This is one of the most cherished movies of all time and almost everyone has seen this movie as a kid and it holds a special place in our hearts.FINAL RATING: 10 out of 10",5
"  A classic. The music and the dialogue just get stuck in your head. Not a perfect adaptation of the Oz story, but a good one.",4
  A true movie classic.,5
"  I would have enjoyed this movie if it weren't for all the green things: the witch, the grass, the Emerald City, the other green things. Why is green so cool nowadays? It's as if they want to force us into their liberal ideals that green is good. I ask you, why is it that ""tree hugger"" is supposed to be an insult? Because if you like nature and the world you're an idiot, that's why. Loving green things and natural things and stuff that lives outside is stupid. It's like liking things that are healthy because it's. good to be healthy. Only liberal-minded hippies enjoy breathing their ""fresh air."" I can't wait for my company to actually successfully make BILLIONS off of our manufactured air machines. Then you all will come back here and make this movie out to be what it is, stupid.They couldn't even make the whole thing in color. The beginning of the movie and the end ***** SPOILER ALERT***** has no color in it. Like, as in old black and white movies. They probably didn't even notice when they sent it out to direct to DVD places - direct to DVD!!!!!! I certainly don't remember this coming out in theaters, so, you tell me.If there was a house flying in the air and it was about to land on you, you'd run away. Unfortunately, this movie's characters, especially the ones who are supposed to be the smart ones, are so dumb they let houses fall on them and they are killed by water. Oh, and don't get me started on the flying monkeys, as if that's not a direct racist commentary on Asian people. I found the dead midget hanging himself and I laughed.Also, don't put on that Dark Side of the Sun album when you watch this because if you do, I heard you might see things.The girl that plays Dorothy can't even sing The cover song that that fat Hawaiian guy sang on his ukulele. There's another thing - if you're going to try to be original, have your own songs. And also, don't steal from other stories like The Hunger Games and Never Ending Story, you know, actual classic, original films. If I could give this negative stars I would. Screw the munchkins and their eerie little town too.",0
  Lovely movie that never gets old. I watch it every Christmas,5
  This movie direction was all over the place. The underline racism makes this movie quite bad. I dislike this film,0

  how is this film considered that good? i mean if it was released today it wouldn't even be played in cinemas...,0
  Let the film explain why this is a classic,5
"  This film is just magical! Despite being made 75 years ago it is fabulous. I don't want to see a remake, this film is perfect as it is.",5
"  The Wizard of Oz may be an old movie (i mean, REALLY REALLY OLD movie) but it's still what it's expected to be: entertaining for the whole family (especially the young ones).",4
"  Um... I'm sorry, why all the praise?! I get that in its day it was innovative, but now NOTHING holds up, I don't think that all old movies are bad, quite contrary actually, I think that movies from the 30's and 40's are really good, because they hold up. This movie looks cheap. I don't mean that it looks fake, they didn't have the technology we have now, that's not what I mean, I just mean that it looks cheap and ugly. Also the acting was awful, and the character of Dorothy was one of the weakest and most uninteresting characters. She shows no strength, unless you count then scene where she gently flicks the cowardly lion on the nose. Also, the plot is STUPID, but that's okay if you care about the emotions and the stakes, but the acting and characters are awful, so you don't care about the emotions, and their are no stakes? It's all a dream. Why does everybody like this movie?!?!?!?!?!?! People only like it because its ""a classic"". Define classic please. Not as good as everybody says.2/5",2

  A movie I grew up loving and appreciated even more as an adult. You could easily take this movie and teach a philosophy college accredited course from its meaning.,5
  The blu-ray looks incredible.,4
  This movie by far is one of the most timeless movies in MGM's film history. The entire movie is a fantastic lesson. It's wholesome theme of a girl that just wants to go home. The way the movie starts out black and white then forwards into color is such a great add on for the viewer. This is a must see for all ages; the young will especially love it.,0
  I great movie me and my mom used to watch it all the time when I was little but she died.,5
"  This movie express many details that make it on cinematic best movies. First, the acting. The acting is magnificent, Judy Garland as Dorthy as she makes her way down the yellow brick road she happens to meet the tin man, lion, and the scarecrow. As acting plays a big part of this amazing film, the plot plays and even bigger. As the story of Dorthy traveling to the land of Oz, then back to Kansas again overall puts together one of the best movies of all time.",5

  Amazing film that stands the test of time!,5
  Wonderful and unforgettable.,5
"  If there is any film that has been made that has stood the test of time its the timeless classic, ""The Wizard Of Oz''. Directed by Victor Fleming and King Vidor, this film was one of the first films made that really pushed the envelope on special effects and grand scale. So much heart was put into this. I haven't met anyone who doesn't love this film.Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland) is a young Kansas girl who lives on a farm. After her dog Toto is taken from her by Miss Gulch (Margret Hamilton), the dog returns. Not knowing what to do, Dorothy and Toto run away. When they return, a tornado is rapidly approaching the farmhouse. Dorothy is knocked unconscious. When she awakes, she has been whisked away to the magical land of Oz, and must save the land from the evil Wicked Witch, with the help of some unlikely heroes. The acting in this film is superb and iconic. While Judy Garland isn't perfect, and her acting is a little over the top, she goes a pretty darn good job. Her companions include Ray Bolger ( The Scarecrow), Jack Haley (The Tin Man), and Bert Lahr (The Cowardly Lion). These gentlemen do a splendid job. The set pieces are magnificent. Also, this film has astounding piratical effects. From the back drops, the tornado, and costumes, everything is top- notch and every detail is paid attention to. ""The Wizard Of Oz'' is a timeless film that touches the heart of everyone. It has memorable charming songs, great acting, impressive special effects, and shows that the old films are still, at times and in some ways, the best.",5
  This movie is a classic that is still loved by many today.,5
"  Yeah, it really is wonderful.",4
"  My parents were close friends of Judy Garland. She was a very nice, extremely nervous person, but we liked her and her family anyway,",5
"  One of my very favorites, and a true classic!",5
"  Possibly the greatest movie ever made. Fun for all ages, this movie has everything for the perfect viewing experience. It's amazing to believe it's 75 years old, a true timeless classic.",5
  Best film ever made for young and old alike,5
"  Well what a movie this classic was. I hadn't seen this movie in years. I can vaguely recall it even. However when I went along to it, It slowly came back to me. And I MEAN slowly. The plot was quite simple, in that Dororthy(Garland) is shushwed up ie swept up in a tornado into a fantasy land. The tornado was so real like, the one in Into the Storm(Review here). It was so impressive. So anyways, Dorothy then is found in a new place and is woken up to Munchkins. Then it is found that there are TWO wicked witches. One of the East)(whom was killed with Dorothy's house) and the Wicked Witch of the West(Hamilton). The Good Witch is also there and helps Dorothy out. Dorothy wanted to return home. However she has to Follow the Yellow Brick Road. People who know me, will know my love for music in Movies. Well this one surely did not disappoint me. I was happily singing all the songs. One thing I did notice was that the songs that were being song I was saying to myself: ""Oh so this is where the song came from"". On the way to the Wizard, Dorothy encounters Scarecrow(Bolger), Tin Man(Haley) and the Lion(Lahr). She told them as she met them on her travels, that she's going to the Wizard in the Emerald City to ask to be sent back home, while so Scarecrow wanted a Brain, Tin Man wanted a Heart, and the Lion wanted Courage. So a conflict ensues with the 4 of them and the Witch. As with any childhood movie, the Winning character is always what I want all the time not the ""baddie"". Then quite a shocker for me personally. Not sure about the rest of yeeee, but the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and the Lion and the ""Wizard"" are all her own family. Which I was saying: ""Isn't that....."" etc., Great childhood movie. Ohhh and the quotes, just unreal. One quote: When the Lion was requesting his Courage: ""What makes a King out of a slave? Courage!"" and the most one quote that really went through me: Considering my heart was broken by my first ex: You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable."" and another quote relating to the heart: "": A heart is shown not by how much you love, but by how much you are loved by others."" So the movie ended on as always with a childhood(well the one's I've seen - hhaha) on a positive note. The Wicked Witch of the WEST, had been defeated. Dorothy was heading back. It was made out to be of a DREAM.",0
"  A timeless delight on all counts! =D A spectacular Musical, Science Fiction & Fantasy movie that at the whole family will enjoy! ^_^",5
"  I'm such a huge fan of everything Oz..... You can't beat a land that has happy Munchkins, a bunch of witches and an Emerald city!! Seeing it in 3D IMAX, wow how amazing!!",5
"  - The 2013 re-issue looks outstanding on Blu-Ray, excellent use of Technicolor. Look forward to watching with my niece at some time as this one's more for kids, but I still can appreciate the technical achievement. - Hadn't seen this since I was a kid, but decided to check out the 70th Anniversary DVD, and glad I did. The film looked amazing. Not necessarily my kind of movie, but I can see why it's a timeless classic. A must-see for all kids!",4
"  There have been several attempts to capitalise on the success of Oz- Disney has given us the terrifying ""Return"" and Sam Raimi the disappointing saccharine CGI miscast misfire prequel. There's been a few animated takes, too, one featured Liza Minelli picking up where her mother left off. Although there is plenty of scope for a franchise, it will never escape the shadow of this bonafide classic of cinema. Anyone who says it hasn't dated is in absolute denial, but it's charm hasn't. The suspension of disbelief, the tenchnicolor, the pantomime outfits and the defining music creates a surreal and innocent adventure that will only sicken the most hardened cynic. The musical theatre off-shoots are banal (Wicked, and the stage adaptation of the film) and should never be considered a legacy, which is just an endless barrage of terrible attempts to cash in on a classic. It stands alone.",5
  There's not much I can say about this movie except that its called a classic for a reason! A-,4
"  With absolutely fantastic and fascinating set design, warm characters, good message for kids and a number of wonderful catchy songs (Over the Rainbow is one of the most beautiful songs in a movie ever), The Wizard of Oz may have some overly dragged songs and sequences and a bit shaky acting, but it is also a visually stunning (the contrast between colourless Kansas ans colorful Oz in Technicolor is artistic and quite brilliant), endearing, adventurous, fun and an overall refined film that surely is one of the best children's movies of all time.",4
"  Awful, awful, awful. Saw it as a child and hated it then. Have watched it several times since and it doesnt improve with age. Overrated rubbish - best avoided.",0
  how do you watch these,0
"  Not just a beautifully crafted piece of work, but also a true cinematic masterpiece that never gets old!",5
"  this is a real gem of a movie for people of all ages,memorable songs and lines like ,theres no place like home and i'll get you my pretty and your little dog too.i highly to kis and the kid ature in all of us .",5
"  Strong female characters hold their own down philosopher L. Frank Baum's yellow brick road. The songs are by turns charming and catchy, the costumes are delightful and the joy of (brand new in 1939) Technicolor still reverberates through the film and highlights the exciting moments. The performances are heartwarming and the messages are still as relevant today as they were then: a classic, timeless, beautiful film.",5
"  Great songs, good fun and utterly timeless. Even the kids sat and watched to the very end. Ding dong!",4
"  It is indeed a film with courage, a brain, a heart, and a home in many people's souls.",5
"  96%A classic for ages to come, The Wizard of Oz combines artful script writing and musical magic to create one of the greatest cinematic achievements in all memory.",5
"  Even though this film is now nearly 500 years old its still as popular as ever, losing none of the sparkle and standing up incredibly well over time.If it can keep a 4 year old used to 21st century T.V. happy then you know its still good..",2
  Classic. Judy a Garland is perfection,5
"  My mother's favorite movie and watched it at least twice a year, I learned to love everything about it. I rather enjoy it myself now but I can't say I still watch it every year. I want to own it on bluray.",5
  Difficult to explain...,5
"  Let's be honest, the appeal of this film only grows with time. The casting is considered perfection. The script: perfection - nearly every piece a dialogue a gem. The songs: too few in the later half of the film, but perfection. The musical score: still catchy, familiar and puts a smile on your face. The special effects: with the exception of the miscued smoke as the Wicked Witch disappears from Munchkinland (watch closely and you'll see it begin prematurely to the left prior to the Margaret Hamilton getting into position), are perfection... the Tornado is STILL a very believable effect 75 years later. It's a right of passage for every child to see it; every child to be frightened of THAT Wicked Witch. It's a shame that the TV landscape has changed such that an annual airing is no longer special. The look of the film - that glorious Technicolor - is unsurpassed. This is one of the finest and most beloved films ever made.",5
"  This magnificent film was named an American classic for a reason by the greatness in its quality, mainly because of its music. (A+)(Full review coming soon)",5
  Truly one of the best films ever made.,5
  Pure family entertainment that certainly has stood the test of time.,5
  How could you not enjoy this classic that has so many quotable lines and set so many standards for future movies to come,5
"  ""The Wizard of Oz"" is definitely one of my favorite movies growing up as a child, and to this day; it is considered to be timeless. It is a film for all ages, and it will continues to live on forever. The movies tells a memorable story with memorable characters, and featuring memorable songs. Judy Garland is Dorothy Gale, and she will always be remember to play that kind of role. The production designs, and the special effects still look amazing today. I don't need to keep going on because everyone as seen this movie, and know that this movie will always be a classic for both children and adults.",5
"  The 75th Anniversary 3D reissue of this classic favorite is FANFREAKINTASTIC!!! Not only was I amazed by the complete restoration of this film for Blu-Ray, but the conversion to 3D is among the best of some of today's made for 3D movies.",5
"  What can you say about this film? We all had this film introduced to us at that young age where it captivates you with its characters, setting, music and story and still after years still stays the timeless classic that gets better after every watch!",5
"  The greatest family film of all time, with unforgettable music and songs (like the Oscar-winning ""Over the Rainbow""), likable characters and the universal theme that there is indeed ""no place like home.""",4
"  Still looks brilliant over 70 years later and the storytelling is immense. All other films must bow before it. Faultless, fantastic, phenomenal. One of the greatest films ever made. Well deserved for being 'Rotten Tomatoes' choice of top film ever made.",5

"  One of the biggest achievements in cinematic history, The Wizard of Oz is a bright, bold, and utterly fantastic film that showcases memorable songs, an incredible acting performance by Judy Garland and old fashioned special effects that have aged unbelievable gracefully.

  The best movie of all time.,5
  I own the four disc DVD and the two disc Blu-Ray,5
"  After a lifetime of unconditionally loving this movie, I recently watched it again waiting for the exact moment in the film that makes it a masterpiece, and I found none. No single moment outshines the next; in this regard, it is smooth as silk. This movie cannot be plucked at and pulled apart, broken down into bite-sized bits to convenience today's ""put it in a nutshell"" mentality. In fact, I was a little bit disappointed at not quite knowing why it is that I love this movie so much. It comes from something that can't be sought after, bottled up or stored in a designated place. It's the magic. This movie boasts no specific frame more magical than the one before it; each one glistens with the magic of a witch's wand, or a ruby slipper, or an emerald city. Naturally I must commend Judy Garland for knowing that and not hesitating to be a child who still believes in such wizardry. This ageless film captivates children of all ages, and for those, like myself, who have forgotten the magic within them, it serves not as a grim reminder of what they left in childhood, but a friendly offer to bring some of the magic back, if not for just an hour-and-a-half, a prospect that brings a tear to my eye and reminds me that the magic is still there as long as beautiful things like ""The Wizard of Oz"" still exist in this crazy world.",5

"  One of the rare classics that has actually managed to achieve the coveted status of being impervious to criticism . . . although, I get the sense that anyone who wants to nitpick the film or even openly hate it is only doing so to draw attention to themselves. Its pure magic from start to finish. I could watch it a thousand times and still be filled with pure, unadulterated joy each time.",6
"  If you keep in mind how old this movie is, and compare it to movies that came out throughout the next 40 years, you'd agree this movie was ahead of it's time. Who hasn't seen this movie? Out of all of the people I've known to have a tv has seen, or even grew up with this movie, and it's no surprise. It is like a family tradition to pass this movie's existence to their kids and grandkids. It is the first achievement in animation history, it's the first movie to be shown in living color, to use convincing live staging effects, and it had a fun cast of characters and music. Imagine growing up in the late 1930s. The world of films were slowly emerging, and all people saw were black and white movies. Back then, these people had no TVs or computers to tell them about upcoming movies, all they had were newspapers, and movie posters. People just came across how The Wizard of Oz was playing, they decided to see what the big deal is. It starts off as a simple colorless movie, but imagine being one of the few who saw it's original release, and how they couldn't believe their eyes when the movie starts showing in color.",4
  One of the best films ever made......truly,5
  Outdated. I know it was incredible in the 30's but nothing in this overrated film has held up. And the hype kills it.,2
  I think this one's obvious. Any further praise would be repetitive.,5
  This film is a classical achievement.,5
  One of my all time favourite films.,5
"  Our class basically finished this book. We think it was amazing and would recommend you read it, too. The fundamental reason you should examine it is that it was amazingly intriguing. An interchange inspiration to examine this book is it had unbelievable unobtrusive components and word choice. Taking everything into account, on the off chance that you like books that could be a bit recondite and alarming, this book is for you! Read the Wizard of Oz by Frank Baum. I brought Wizard of Oz Collection from Snazal WholeSale Books and there service was very good.",0
  Absolute perfection. A true classic. Every one by the age of 21 should know the songs word for word. A delight.,5
"  The most overrated movie ever made. Surely a spellbinding work in its time, the Wizard of Oz hasn't held up well. Garland gives a great performance, but otherwise the cast is mediocre at best, the production value and special effects are beyond outdated, and several long and largely pointless musical numbers grind the picture to a halt. It's movies like this that make me lose a little respect for modern critics, who have hive-minded it into its undeserved status as a ""classic.""",1

"  Wow... this movie is so hard to review properly. It's one of those films where it's just so good to the point where it's hard to say anything wrong with it. As much as I love this movie though, The Wizard of Oz is flawed in a few different ways. So I guess let's just dive right in. I also promise not to mention ""Wicked"" too much considering the book didn't even exist yet.  Should I even describe the story to you? I mean you all know it... okay might as well do this right. Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland) wants to find a new place to explore Over The Rainbow and a twister of fate (literally) whisks her away to The Land of Oz. There she comes across all sort of characters like The Scarcrow with no brain, The Tin Man with no heart and a Lion with no courage at all. However, Dorothy longs to go back home but the only way to do that is to see The Wizard Of Oz. She'll have to face the Wicked witch of The West along the way with other obstacles as well. I'll just have say this movie does feel really timeless. I mean yeah there are one or two times when you can tell these people are on a movie set but a lot of the time it genuinely feels like Oz is a true and real place.  The movie is pretty to look at, but what about the characters? Honestly, they're great too. There isn't much to Dorothy as a character, but it's really touching to see how much she wants to go home because she is so worried about her Aunt Em. The Scare Crow, Tin Man and Lion more than half the time get some funny lines. The Wicked Witch of The West is awesome, but kind of one dimensional. This is why a story like Wicked is needed for this character. Almost like with Maleficent, The Wicked Witch is awesome at being evil but really doesn't have a motivation. Yeah you can make the argument she wants revenge for her faltened sister under Dorothy's house, but she never really brings her up. Supposedly, those ruby slippers have some type of power to them but again I don't see how they would be useful to a plan we know nothing about. Still, The wicked Witch is a pretty cool villain.  The music in this film is really great. I think there are only two songs I don't like. First off, the whole Munchkin song routine goes on forever and it gets old really quickly. Also, The Lion's song about wanting to be king of the forest really doesn't do anything for me either. Besides those two, I love these musical numbers. My Favorite has to be Somewhere Over The Rainbow. Can you believe they almost cut out this song for time? Wow that probably would've been a huge mistake. I have listened to Somewhere Over The Rainbow at least 120 times. Then again, I have listened to ""Defying Gravity"" probably thousands of times but again we're not suppose to be talking about Wicked aren't we?  There are two major things that really bother me in The Wizard of Oz. The first is a line spoken by The Wizard when he's giving the Tin Man his ""heart"". This line totally drives me nuts. ""It 's not important how much you love, but how much you're loved by others"". Um yeah this is pretty messed up. He completely has that line backwards. You should just love your heart out even if some people won't appreciate you for it. Anyway, the other big issue I have with this film is also a big issue a lot of people have with it. This might be somewhat of a spoiler, but again I'm sure all of you know it. Glinda pretty much knew all along that the Ruby Slippers could've took Dorothy home 2 seconds after she got to Oz. DOn't get me wrong, I know the reasoning why Glinda didn't tell her this important fact even if I don't understand it. Dorothy was suppose to learn that her heart's desire was and always will be in Kansas. However you could make the argument that Dorothy knew this for the longest time. That's why she wouldn't stop talking about going back to Kansas. All Glinda had to do was tell her and she wouldn't have almost died at the hands of The Wicked Witch. So Dorothy was put in the middle of this huge mess in Oz because...? Yeah that's a huge problem in an otherwise great film.  The Wizard of Oz is truly an amazing film. Yeah, there are two huge problems that make it impossible to say it's a perfect film but I think being amazing is enough. It has great songs, great characters, a wonderful (sometimes confusing) story and also great acting from the entire cast. Needless to say, I highly recommend The Wizard of Oz.",4
"  Well, it's the 75th anniversary of the all-American classic The Wizard of Oz. No matter when you were born, grew up, and lived out your adulthood, you've seen this movie if you were born any time in the last two centuries. Nostalgic lookbacks don't always mean the film or piece of media you are looking back on a piece of art, but 'Oz' still holds it's own after three-quarters of a century have gone by. To say the story is almost pointless, it's simple and as well known as your own middle name. Dorothy Gale, a country girl from Kansas, desires something spectacular beyond her roots after getting into trouble when her beloved pooch Toto bites the Gale's wealthy neighbor Almira Gulch. Gulch swears to ""destroy"" Toto (probably euthanizing him or something) and takes him in a basket which he hastily escapes. Dorothy thinks of running away to avoid Toto being re-captured, and that's where they come across Professor Marvel, a psychic of sorts who reads in a crystal ball that Auntie Em, Dorothy's caregiver, is ill. Feeling guilty, Dorothy attempts to return home but a sudden twister comes upon Kansas which launches the Gale house into thin air and drops it into the land of Oz. Dorothy is flabbergasted with this new place, but at the same time she desires to return home after a Wicked Witch vows to get her newly acquired ruby slippers, which belonged to the witches sister. She is informed to go to the Wizard of Oz for help, and she follows the yellow brick road to do just that. On the way, she encounters colorful characters (Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion) who join her on her journey to Oz in pursuit of their specific desires. The Good, The Bad, and The Review:Good: Do I even need to say what's great about this movie? The acting for one is very legitimate, probably because it was done in a time before celebrities felt the need to give their own 'uniqueness' to characters rather than they themselves being the characters. Judy Garland is a perfect Dorothy, not quite gorgeous, but definitely not ugly either. Not too old or too young. She gives the right amount of charm that can never again be replicated in any other adaptation of this story. The same goes for a lot of the other characters, especially The Wicked Witch of the West. Easily one of the Top 5 Greatest Movie Villians of all time, this woman was the source of many of my childhood fears. Diabolical, sinister and just loving what she does, Margaret Hamilton puts a lot of effort into making this villain leave an impact.. So most of the strength of the plot comes from the main character and the villain, but the side characters are all memorable and far from filler room as they are in most modern productions. They all have distinct personalities, desires, and dreams. And the story does summarize with them creatively realizing that hidden talent and ability (smarts, love, and courage respectively). The visuals are still beautiful to look at, the 'twister', darkened sepia Kansas, and of course Oz. They were state of the art for the 30's and like many other old movies haven't lost their charm to this day. A lot of the Oz backgrounds have an innocent cartoon feeling much like something hand drawn by Disney. It's obvious to see that the Witch wasn't the only element in the film that 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarves' before it inspired. It's like something out of a dream, the picture perfect fantasy land we always go back to. Any modern day adaptation, including last years ""Oz: The Great and Powerful"" which I liked would overdose on CGI and other computer brilliance which while it looks nice it would be distracting enough to create a 'style vs. substance' war rather than tell the story. This film doesn't do that, obviously. Staying in the realm of the story arc while bringing out Emerald-like shine. The music and songs are also all memorable, ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"", ""Ding Dong, the Witch is Dead"", ""We're off to see the Wizard"", ""If I Only Had a Brain/Heart/The Nerve"", all household favorites that also haven't lost their luster. The score also comes across like a dream, something so surreal it can't be real. The opening and closing montage just sucks you in with it's conservative graceful melody and helps us better relate to this relatively simple story. Bad: I personally have always strayed from belief in a perfect movie, as films are carved with the hands of humans, imperfect beings with fickle whims. So naturally, in every work of art, someone is bound to find a flaw somewhere. However, there's nothing really to nitpick here. No noticeable plot holes or explanations that don't make sense. It is rather simple, but we expect it to be. It's simplicity is half it's charm. There's also nothing unnecessary in it, no superfluous character or detail or any slip up from a director or producer. If I find something wrong with it, I'll let you know.Review: The Wizard of Oz is still as timeless, breathtaking, inspiring, and fun as it was in it's 1939 release. One of my favorite movies that I will surely return to in the future many times.",6
"  It would have been an incredible film if it was made and released today. A film released 75 years ago, with the special effects it has, is incredible. Simply, this is a film which everyone must see at some point in their lives.",5
  I've loved this movie since I was a kid. Margaret Hamilton is the best part.,6
  Judy Garland and the cast bring L.Frank Baum's classic story to live in this magnificent classic.,5
"  Its deviations from the source material make it a little upsetting to fans of Baum's novel, but who can honestly argue with the film's irresistible charm and energy?",4
  All-time favorite movie!,5
  Thank you MGM and Warner Bros giving me this movie as part of my childhood!,5
  One of the top 3 movies of all time,5
"  A fantastic masterpiece that was the highlight of films for the 1930's, a true spectacle that will go down as one of the best.",4
  what a classic. just wonderful,5

  Didn't bother to watch it.,4
"  Is it amazing? It may seem so for a 1939 film, but overall it is a really weird movie, too weird for my taste. Seriously, too too weird. The lesson was lame as well. ""Believe""??!! What kind of lesson was that? And seriously, couldn't the fairy have given the shoes when Dorothy met her? Oh--and finally, everything was a dream. well, 90% of the movie, any how. Inception made a much better excuse.",2
"  Fifteen years after the premier showing in 1939 I was able to see the original movie as the Wizard of Oz was available to be experienced again. I was memorized by the film and I remain the same today. Now, in 3D for home theaters, I found the movie again a thrill to watch. The color is even more beautiful and the added 3D and the classic will remain in the hearts of the people forever.",0
"  The ultimate chick-flick with two women fighting over a pair of shoes, but still visually entertaining with sing-along fun. Plus, if you listen to ""Dark Side of the Moon"" on in the background, it's even better.",5
"  All time BEST movie ever and in 3D it's just THAT much better. A movie done how a movie should be done, with a story line, good acting, and family friendly. You don't have to have sex and nudity to make people love it. This one has stood the test of time and is still loved by audiences around the world.",5
  What else needs to be said about one of the top 20 films of all time...,5
  Classic! Must have seen it more than 5 times as a kid.,4
  The art direction is monumentally brilliant. The music is splendid. Judy Garland is lovely and amazing in everything ever. Exceptional film-making; timeless and beautiful.,5
"  How could you not be captivated and engrossed by this movie that changed filmmaking forever? This movie goes far and beyond your wildest dreams. Even for 1939, this movie changed everything I know about movies and the way films are perceived today.",5
"  This gets my vote as the greatest film of all time. Frequently mentioned as one of the best movies ever, but rarely the absolute best, it's a timeless masterpiece that has had more impact on American culture than any other film in history with the possible exception of Star Wars. I think it deserves even more attention and acclaim. It's film making at its purest and finest.",5
"  One of the most beautiful pictures to come to cinema.You wish for another remake at the same time you don`t want one, since this is as good as it is ever going to be.",5
"  Still one of the best, timeless and shows that you don't need technology to make a film that's ahead of it's time.",5
"  The Wizard of Oz broke the mold for all family films to follow. Without it we might not have classics like Mary Poppins and Pete's Dragon. The story itself is well known and is the best story that teaches the moral ""There's no place like home."" Oz still looks fantastic after all these years. Similar to what I said in my Mary Poppins review it's seems more magical and special than movies that had everything created by computers. Who hasn't wanted to visit Oz at one point in their lives? The perfomances are great, and extremly iconic. The songs are all cute, and impossible to get out of your head. Once they're in there there's no getting them out. There are several versions of this story, but this is the one everyone will always remember, and after 75 years it's very easy to see why.",5
"  ""The Wizard of Oz"" is more than just memorable quotes and a famous song. It is a tale about the dreams of teenage girl. It is a film that restores our belief in the imagination. It's beautiful art direction and costume design are influential and just a joy to gaze at. Performances and songs aside, this film is something to behold, a spectacle on every level. If you were to consider the music and performances, as well as it's legendary screenplay, you'll begin to understand the importance and greatness of this movie.",5
"  Finally! watched it The Wizard of Oz, One of The best classic original film, Of course the best part of this movies Its not just a beautiful voice of Jury Garland. I think the power of this movie is the fantastic wonderful art and how director present to the audience like ""You've never seen it before"" and I think its works. Then speech of this movie is really sharp together with comical. 2 Hours with this movie I'm really enjoying it and the end of this movie though its familiar like others movies but It still works anywhere about There's no place like home.",4
  Best movie of all time,5
  Just see and we'll talk about its flawlessness,5
  94%A cinema game changer--even despite its flaws.,4
  Out on 3d Blu ray on Tuesday. Great escapist fare considering it is the same day obamacare goes into affect,4
  Like I'm really going to give this any less than 5 stars...,5
  probably the ultimate fantasy/musical movie of all time.,4
  Still works 100% after all this time. And visuals are perfect- they don't have green screen animation that are out of place. Also Judy Garland is amazing!!,5
  i really like this movie,5
"  What did Dorothy say at the end of this movie to melt the Wicked Witch of the West? If I ever say the same thing, whatever it is she said, that is, will I get rid of those bad guys always watching everything I'm doing?",4
"  The songs though iconic, seemed forced.",0
"  A classic that lives on despite advances in technology. It starts off in a brownish hue in Kansas where she gets caught in a storm and gets knocked out. She travels to Oz in full color and crushes the wicked witch of the west and is given her ruby slippers. She tries to follow the yellow brick road to find the wizard and make it back home. Along the way, she meets the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion (as well as a bird who people think is a dead Munchkin). It's a classic story that's been revisited a few times over the years, but this one still holds up quite well. The sets are a bit cheap by today's standards, but that's a product of the time. Still one of the all time great movies.",4
  Oz the great to erin,0
  Amazing film my favourite movie I love it,5
  Great classical musical. I'm doing a production of TWOZ at college; and I'm playing the role of the Tinman.,4
"  My history with this film is not good. I believe I might have seen it first when I was a little too young. As a result I considered it kind of scary instead of fun. So then I just avoided watching it as I grew up. On the rare occasion that I watched it I just couldn't enjoy it. Recently my wife received Wizard of Oz on DVD, though, and insisted I give it another chance. I figured there was a chance I might have always prejudged it based on my first experience, so I gave it a shot. Sorry, but I just don't get it. Clearly this feels like a kids' movie but they include so many creepy elements from a wicked witch to flying monkeys. Frankly I even find the Munchkins a little unsettling. I'm not even sure they effectively explain the ""lesson"" that Dorothy learns at the end. Judy Garland acts like a five-year-old while looking like a twenty-year-old. On the positive side she definitely can sing. The songs are probably the biggest highlight of the film. I thought all the acting was just too melodramatic. This is why I'm convinced it's intended as a children's movie because there is zero subtlety to any of the performances. My favorite acting in the film all comes from Frank Morgan, who also adds 90% of the humor to the story. He plays 5 different characters better than most of the others play 1.Perhaps my biggest issue with this movie is how illogical it all seems. Glinda could send Dorothy home from the beginning but sends her on a pointless quest first? Glinda forces the ruby slippers on Dorothy's feet, creating the entire conflict between her and the wicked witch? The wizard sends a little girl to commit murder for him, for no particular reason? And none of that even mentions the worst part, because no resolution came in the Toto-vs-Gulch situation, so she'll just come back and have him put to sleep as before. So the primary conflict is never resolved. Dorothy wasn't running away because she didn't appreciate home, she was running away to save her pet. Yeah, so I give up. This clearly is not a film that is for me, and I'd be fine never watching it again, but I'll still listen to the soundtrack for some of those good songs.",1
  One of the best films ever made,5
"  Although it will be more enthralling for the young ones in terms of story and content, one cannot take away the fact that The Wizard of Oz visually stunning beyond it's years, genuinely tuneful, and earnestly charming. Wonderful performances all around, particularly from Bolger, Lahr, and Haley as The Scarecrow, The Cowardly Lion, and the Tin Man respectively. Margaret Hamilton is particularly memorable as the ever-so-quotable Wicked Witch of the North. The new HD restoration highlights how brilliant the costumes and the make-up effects are and remain nearly 75 years later, even if the increased detail reveals where the lovely sets end and the matte paintings begin.",4
"  A rich, whimsical romp, The Wizard of Oz is a cornerstone of popular culture, with wonderful sets and costumes, timeless songs and a story which even today, 75 years later, is emotionally stirring. All of this is anchored by bravura performances from Margaret Hamilton and Judy Garland.",5
"  Anyone who has not seen this film at least once in their life clearly is missing out on something big. Once you have seen this magical story, there is no going back!",5
"  Great All Time Classic!! A movie that has lasted for generations, and will continue to do so for years to come.",5
  One of the greatest movies of all time.,5
"  How could you possibly hate The Wizard of Oz? It's the reason we love movies and go to see them. It's a wild magical cinematic journey that will always be beloved by those who are ""young at heart"".",5
  I hadn't seen this since I was a kid. I had no fond memories of it. I can now say I still have none. This was painful to watch.,1
  A classic ageless my niece and nephews love it over 7 decades later and it's still relevant,5
  a amazing movie. it's a great classic that neither I or my family can stop watching,5
  Do I really need to explain?,5
"  It's The Wizard of Oz. How do you write a review for a film where you can quote almost the entire movie, badly sing along to the music, and point out references to the film almost daily everywhere you go? It's hard, and while the film, like every film, has it's share of flaws (such as minor special effects glitches, actors in borderline-Halloween costumes, and some plot holes), they are so minor and insignificant, they are easy to overlook when the film is littered with the most quotable dialogue ever, BRILLIANT performances (especially from Margaret Hamilton), BEAUTIFUL set design and art direction (all without computers), great music, and a universal message about home. You can forgive this film for just about everything. It gets more things right than any other film ever in my opinion, even things it didn't have to.",5
"  There's g,gg gdtnfguhh cjmkd",1
  quite possibly the perfect film,5
  The Wizard Of Oz will always be the gold standard when it comes to film. It's a timeless tale with colorful characters and wonderful songs that make it one of my favorite movies! (First viewing - Childhood),5
"  It's a classic, everyone has seen it.",5
"  Great movie for kids, an for any grownup young at heart.",5
"  I remember watching this as a small child back in the late 1970s, again as nine year old in the early 1980s, and as a fourteen year old in the late 1980s. The first time, I think I liked it. The second time, I remember I had a bad dream that the Wicked Witch of the West was chasing after me on a broomstick. In the dream, I remember I threw a bucket of water on the Wicked Witch, and she melted away.By the time I got to my teens, I found this film reminded me of a shopping centre pantomime- cloying and patronizing, and I hated it. I still cannot bring myself to like The Wizard of Oz. Call me cold hearted if you will, but there are plenty of films from my childhood (anything starring The Muppets) that I still cherish today, and I would rather watch those instead of this.",2
  They don't make movies like this any more. Unfortunately.,4
  This is a timeless movie... hard not to give it a great rating.,4
  Oh... The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.,4
"  Amidst the plethora of ""Best Film"" lists this year, the most notable exclusion was the 75th Anniversary ""Wizard of Oz 3D."" The restoration/re-invention was arguably the year's most completely enjoyable film. Familiarity , far from breeding contempt, brings new respect, love and appreciation for this timeless masterpiece.  Hubertus W. Zegers",5

  The Best and Most Beloved Movies Of All Time,4
  I hope this come to Korea!!,0
  If you hate this movie then you have you soul at all. this movie takes you to a yellow brick road with Dorothy and her odd friends.,5
  Can there be anybody on the planet who hasn't seen this movie? I defy anyone not to be enchanted by the tale of Dorothy Gale and her quest to find her way back to Kansas. Everything about his film is just right. The switch from monochrome to garish Technicolor as the cabin door swings open onto Oz is still magical to behold and Margaret Hamilton is the best witch in cinema history. Generations of kids have been bought up with this movie and the songs and characters are just so familiar to us that it is hard to imagine that anything could be done to improve it.,5
  fantastic film one of the best ever made,5
  A movie you would want to see over and over again.....priceless!,5
  The Wizard of Oz is no more than a bland and mediocre production.,2
"  An absolute masterpiece with ""actual great music"", unbelievable brilliant songs, so many powerful messages, and the cowardly lion was a great character. The actor who played him should have been US president. So good. Dorothy was so earnest and humble, as well as very gentle. The Wizard was a bum but that's why we had 60's counterculture and wizards, the Scarecrow was a great man and the tin man was solid. I loved the two witches, the wicked witch was a brilliant character, but the main thing that made this movie special was the amazing music, just perfect. Totally not for kids, kids wouldn't understand the complexity of this movie, they would be bored by it. Unless the smart-aleccy ambitious type, that peaks at 15. Not me, I love this movie! and the flying monkeys were perfect and stunning, I can't wait to see more movies about this messed up land of Oz. Totally great. twice as good as the 2013 one, being humble about that makes this movie even better. There is something to it that is just so coy and clever, so much brilliant acting, and when she goes ""home"", it was so good.",5
  One of the greatest films of all time.. When you consider the fact that this film was made in the late 30's? WOW!! The characters will be remembered forever.. For anyone to rate this film low they have really no sense of what's good in motion pictures.. I mean it was made in 1939?? Long before all the crap CGI junk..,4
  One of the greatest films ever made,5

  i love it. masterpiece,5
"  A timeless classic. Hardly an original thought, but still the truth. A highlight of 30's cinema.",4
"  I love this classic! It had a great story, great characters, great music, great emotions and beautiful colors. Judy Garland was a gem as Dorothy. She put so much heart into the character. It's one of those movie that made me cry.",5
"  While a bit unbalanced when it comes into the third act, the rest of The Wizard of Oz runs flawlessly, with its especially cathcy soundtrack, groundbreaking special effects, great and charming performances, crisp story that's character-driven and a sense of wonder all around. Oz inspired a lot of magical colorful worlds in fantasy movies and even today it's a huge classic. The Wizard of Oz is one of those movies that gets everything right, and it just feels wondeful. Plus, this movie masterfully puts multi character developlment in a way i haven't see anywere else. The Wizard of Oz is a timeless musical trip.  That Glinda Witch is really a bitch, i mean ""I didn't tell you before about the red shoe because you wouldn't believe me"". Damn, what a cop-out.",4
"  The Wizard Of Oz, one of cinema's most outstanding masterpieces of all time, with its magistral visuals, catchy, memorable & inmortal songs and excellent characters, everyone of them very-well developed, and great storytelling. A timeless classic of musicals and cinema history.",5
  What do I say...this is just one of those classics.,5
"  If you're looking for a film to watch during Christmas then you should pick this one up. It is absolutely amazing for a family film back then with a neat cast, enjoyable songs and awesome sets. One of the best family films ever made.",5

  My All-Time Favorite,0
  This is a timeless classic. I can't remember how many times I've watched this film. It's amazing and I don't think I'll ever grow to old to watch it..lol.,5
"  A perfect film from what is probably one of the most important years for American Cinema. I am puzzled how anyone could not assign the highest rating possible. If I could add a star, I would.",5
  No need to say too much about this movie. I remember when I was little and it was such a big deal when it was coming on tv. It came on about once a year. Vcr's and dvd players have taken away that excitement. I was really scared of the tornado scenes.,5
  This movie is a Classic to everybody and your little dog too.,4
"  Um, it's one of the best frickin' movies of all time. Plain and simple. If you're not a fan of ""The Wizard of Oz"", you're not a fan of movies.",5
"  to be seriously honest,i've never saw this one before,I mean,I did see anime adaptations,cartoons (superfriends were one of them) I even saw that Michael Jackson one ""The Wiz""(piece of crap) but never actually took the time to watch this cinematic gem.I really have to admit i was literally amazed by a lot things: Make up,Props,Backdrops,""Special FX"" art direction and,of course ""The Technicolor"".The acting was pretty good,I found july garland's acting a little over the top and very dramatic at times...other than that...this film is just pure gold!!,I can see myself watching it 30 years from now and still enjoying it!",4

  the be movie ever I used to make my grandma let me watch it over and over again haha poor grandma,5
"  I finally saw this on the big screen; in 3D IMAX to boot. Was that necessary? Probably not, but it was so worth seeing on the big screen. It may not be perfect, and it may be in some ways of its time. But seeing it as it should have been seen, you see all the details that make it so great, you see why its as great as it was and you really do appreciate it.",4

"  Je l'idealisais depuis au moins 10 ans. Je n'ai pas ete decu. Non seulement Le Magicien d'Oz est un film absolument passionnant, emouvant, amusant, hilarant par moments et visuellement splendide, le film est aussi parfaitement bien realise, dote d'un rythme endiable qui ne laisse jamais un temps mort s'installer et tres bien joue par l'immense Judy Garland. Un des films fondateurs du cinema contemporain. Et la 3D est tres reussie.",5
"  Time for another one of THOSE reviews. Well, what can I say, this movie is anus. The Wizard of Oz is a prime example of how nostalgia can sway a person's opinion on a movie. Every critic who gave this a fresh score did so only because they probably fell in butt-love with it when they were six and never decided to grow up. And as it is with most kid's movies, people say that it should be judged on a different scale, as the target audience is different. My response? FUCK YOU. A movie's so-called 'target audience' should not be called into question when giving it a score. By that logic, if a film is made by retards, about retards, FOR retards, and it does the job well, it should get 100%. And that is something I cannot abide.  Hence, my hatred for The Wizard of Oz. This film isn't just bad, it's GRATING. It's a kid's movie, so you shouldn't expect much of it, but GOOD HOLY FUCK, they could have made some effort. The supposedly 'great' line ""Toto... I don't think we're in Kansas anymore..."" is not only corny, it is delivered in such a way that is just painful to the ears. Every line is overexaggerated, every moment is over the top, and every performance is just fucking awful. This is the point where people usually say ""Calm down, man... it's just a kid's movie."" EXACTLY. It's made for kids, who are clearly undemanding in their entertainment and too 'impressionable' to handle real cinema like Pulp Fiction or Fight Club without getting their brains turned to mush. The fact that our professional critics would dare to give good reviews to this safe, alarmingly small-minded movie should be enough to make us think for at least a minute about the current state of our society.  The Wizard of Oz is about Dorothy, a stereotypical Kansas girl whose character is entirely one-dimensional, and who is played horribly by Judy Garland, who gives the term 'emoting' a whole new meaning. She's on-par with Jake Lloyd in The Phantom Menace on my list of ""Most Annoying Performances of All Time."" Is it supposed to be 'heartwarming?' Supposedly. But to someone who hasn't obsessed over this movie and the supposed 'impact' it made on cinema for his whole life, I find it to be grating and unwatchable. None of the performances, in fact, are any good. They're loud, sure, and they grip your attention because of it-- but not in a good way. People say the special effects are good, which they might have been for the time, but looking back now, they're really not. The makeup makes everyone look retarded, and half the time you're nervous that Dorothy is going to accidentally knock over the backdrop painting instead of paying attention to the movie.  The plot itself is just fucking retarded. Dorothy gets a severe blow to the head (which actually explains a lot), and has a hallucination in which she's whisked away to the magical land of Oz. Apparently, back in the 30s, color film qualified as 'magic.' A buttload of annoying creatures called munchkins greet her, and they sing. Their singing is the worst of all fucking time. Seriously. It's like the Ewoks from Star Wars removed their bear costumes, joined hands, inhaled Helium, and danced around while singing the most retarded song of all time. She then meets up with the Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion, and the Tin Man, three lame characters played by three even lamer actors. After jackassing around in the woods for a half an hour, they defeat the Wicked Witch of the West (who, in a remake, would be played by Barbara Boxer) by pouring water on her. So... that was easy. Also, all the witch really ever did was fly around and yell at them, writing shit in the sky. Kind of a harsh punishment for that...  Anyway, now for the ultimate dumb moment in all of cinema: The Good Witch tells Dorothy that she could have gone home whenever she wanted to just by clicking her heels. GREAT ADVICE, BITCH! That would probably have come in handy a little earlier! And then Dorothy wakes up... and IT WAS ALL A DREAM. Not in an Inception-like way, where the dream actually impacts reality-- BUT JUST A REGULAR FUCKING PIPE DREAM BROUGHT ON BY A SEMI-SEVERE CONCUSSION!!! What was the point of the movie then? The stakes couldn't be raised because THERE WERE NO STAKES!!! She was fine for the whole fucking time!!! It's the ultimate cop-out ending, and makes the entire movie pointless BY DEFINITION. God, this movie suuuuucks...  Final Score for The Wizard of Anus: 1/10 stars. Really, I only hate this enough to give it a 3 or a 2, but seeing how overrated and hyped it is makes me hate it even more. Nostalgic old people love this movie, and young reviewers like it because frankly, they're scared to give it a bad review. But there is literally no redeeming value in this enormous load of cinematic anus. Not since Hugo and Up have the critics failed so monumentally as they have with The Wizard of Oz. It's horribly written, it's poorly acted, and the visuals (although impressive 70 years ago, I'm sure) have not held up whatsoever. One of the most overhyped pieces of shit ever made.",0
  One of the All time greats,5
"  One of the most iconic films of all time, ""The Wizard of Oz"" captured feelings of true magic and is impressive to this day. The cast and crew poured their souls into their work and it truly shows. The 75th anniversary, theatrical re-release in IMAX 3D was a wonderful and rare opportunity. The set design, costumes, make-up, special effects and cast were absolutely phenomenal, especially considering it was all done in 1939. The clarity in the re-mastered edition is a great sight to see. Oz set the standard for films back in the day, but few have ever come close to capturing countless generations imaginations as this classic has succeeded in doing. If any film deserves to be called a classic, this is it.",5
  My 2nd favorite movie of all time!!,5
"  I tend to not go see the 3D movies. Often times they seem inflated beyond belief, with interests less artistic than commercial. I'm not too fond for eye-aches or surcharges, either. But what IMAX has done to Victor Fleming's The Wizard of Oz is magnificent. Now Dorothy and the gang walk on not just sets, but worlds. The hills rolling in the background, the trees that recede into the distance. Everything is not lifelike - it doesn't need to be. It is fantastical and beautiful. Sure, the movie may be too obvious at times. But Jesus Christ, this is American mythology, immortalized in our most interesting medium - film. It is pure joy. And trust me, the 3D effects that enhance its visuals have done much justice. To watch this movie on the big screen is amazing. This movie has a heart of pure gold, I tell you. To see it projected on a screen too big for my eyes to follow makes the story larger than life.",5
  I love it ! 3-D I Max was excellent,5
  Loved it even if has been more than 25 years since it first came on screen!,5
"  The Wizard of Oz is timeless. So simple, so honest, but so deep in its messages about love and self-discovery. All of the actors including the veteran Billie Burke would be remembered the most for their roles here more than any other movie. The set direction is made to look as close to a storybook; all that is missing are the page frames. There isn't a false move here, and all those back-stories... well, their okay to read but for the cinema lover looking for magic, it's all here, in about two hours of pure entertainment. 5/5!",5
  Must see in the IMAX theater. Most awesome.,5
  exceptional exceptional never losses is impact.,5
  A classic that started it all. Everyone should watch this film before seeing the following spinoff's Wicked and Oz The Great And Powerful.,5
  One of the greatest movies I ever seen,5
"  it's a classic, my favorite character would have to be the Wicked Witch",5
  I heard from a guy that lived in 1939 that says this movie was the best movie of the year. can't wait to see it!,5
  Scary. Weird. Nonsense....,1
"  Amazing!!! They did an awesome job, I felt like I was in the movie!",5
  EVERYTHING I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ON THE BIG SCREEN AND MORE!!!,5
  Soooooooooo boring and soooooo much stupid singing,0
  What an experience! Still as fun and great as ever.,5
"  This is a must see for young and old alike. After seeing it on the constraints of my TV for the past 50 years the IMAX 3D Experience takes the film to a whole different level. Colors explode, you see things never seen before and you become part of Dorothy's journey home.",5
  Absolutely loved it!! Seen things I've never seen before. Awesome seeing it in IMAX theater.,4
  Watching the Wizard of Oz in 3D IMAX was incredible! The depth & detail was instantly noticeable in virtually every scene. If it wasn't for the ancient props & effects(& the fact you've seen it 100 times) you wouldn't realize you were watching a 75 year old movie! A great movie experience!,5
  The Wizard of Oz is #1 movie of my lifetime. I still watch it every chance I get. How the wicked witch appears and disappears still amaze me. 1939 unbelievable.,4
"  As one of my favorite movies from my childhood (which I also watched innumerable times in my teens and later as an adult), I felt like I owed myself seeing ""The Wizard of Oz"" in IMAX 3-D. So I did, and as a result, I think that I have finally come to closure now on viewing ""The Wizard of Oz."" Frankly, I think the movie would have been just as great on the huge IMAX screen WITHOUT the 3-D, which sort of felt like overkill. Even the giant IMAX screen with its higher definition made some of the props and backgrounds suddenly look much more fake, cheapening their appearance. That saddened me but other aspects were still amazing, especially the quality of some of the special effects used 75 years ago! For instance, Glenda, The Good Witch's entrances via her giant pink bubble. And yes, the IMAX screen and probably the 3-D made Glenda even more resplendent in that sparkly cotton candy pink confection of a gown and her translucent glittery crown. I even noticed for the first time that her sparkly necklace was in the shape of a butterfly, and I would not have thought I could have possibly missed any such detail in past viewings. LOL! Plus, the landings and takeoffs of the flying monkeys are still impressive decades later! All-in-all, for any longtime fan of the film, it's probably worth having this special viewing experience. :)",4
"  I just saw this in IMAX and was thrilled to see how much I have missed in the years of past viewing. Every freckle on Dorothy, each dent and scratch on the Tinman, close ups of the fantastic Make-up on the Scarecrow, and each wonderfully twisted curl of the Cowardly Lion. Mid way through this film I realized that it should have been shot in 3D to begin with. The sets are all produced to force perspective soooo well that the 3D simply clarifies and tells the truth about each camera angle. Inward depth of this film is extraordinary and Looks totally planned for 3D shooting. The beginning of the film terrified me with the best special effects beyond what I have seen in any modern movie. When Dorothy finds the cellar door during the Twister scene, you will pee your pants just wanting to save her from the giant menace of a twister. Kansas appears flat and lonely like we have never before been able to distinguish. But when Dorothy lands her house and opens her front door into OZ, YOU WILL BE FLOORED. This is the first time seeing OZ that I truly felt like I was there. YES, this grown man teared up simply because of the Technical Beauty that was being displayed, and YES because I really did want to believe it was real. This is the way this movie should have been produced had we had the technology. Don't question it, just go see it and you too will be amazed! THANK YOU TO IMAX AND THEIR AFFILIATES .",0
  LOVED IT!!!!! It had much more detail and clarity!!!,5
  Great experience!! Best quality picture and Sound.,5
  There is nothing like seeing it on the big screen!,5
  I cried... It was absolutely stunning! Judy Garland looked marvelous on the big screen and the 3D wasn't distracting.,5
"  It's one of the most cinematically, culturally, and historically significant films of all time, and that's no overstatement. The Wizard of Oz should be witnessed by all, who will treasure its groundbreaking cinematography and special effects, unforgettable soundtrack, and excellent storytelling that's timeless to date.",5
  I saw it and it was just as entertaining as it was the first time I saw it as a kid! Really cute movie.,0
  Just as phenomenal as being in the movie yourself!,0
"  The Wizard of Oz is showing at AMC Altamonte all day is tomorrow for $16.00 (or 11:40 at $10.50). Then Fri, Sat & Sun. it will only show at 11:40 $10.50. Then a Mon showing at noonish. The countdown is on!",5
"  Excellent experience-- the whole family enjoyed the refreshed, brighter, bolder and cleaner Wizard of Oz. Saw it on the big screen a few years ago, but this was much improved... and the movie NEVER gets old.",5
"  I have literally watched this movie hundreds of times, it makes me smile, it mesmerizes me. This version was amazing, at one point it felt like Dorothy was standing close enough to touch. Such a well written well performed movie, for it's time, for my time and for ALL TIME!!!!!!!",0
"  Just the BEST MOVIE EVER. Best story, best actors, best everything.",5
"  It's a bit pricey. If you love The Wizard of Oz just as much as i do, Then it's worth the price.",5
"  It was amazing! The restoration of the film makes it look like a new film, The 3D is subtle, and has no cheesy shots added.",4
  Gets better every time I watch it. To see it in 3D was amazing! I still get teary-eyed when Dorothy thinks she may die when the hourglass runs out.,0
  visually crystal clear....saw every freckle on Dorothy and so much costume and make up detail..lovely,5
"  It was a beautiful version in IMAX 3D. I've seen this movie so many times it's almost a part of me, but seeing like this just enhanced everything.",5
"  I am not going to comment on the movie, per se, but more on the IMAX 3d part of the experience. It felt like I wasn't really watching a movie, but that I was there, on the stage as they were filming a movie. You can see the depth of the sound stage, the materials of the stage themselves. The only better way you could have seen this if you were there when they made it. Wow just WOW!",4
"  Wow! What a totally original idea. Put a timeless classic in IMAX, wonderful inventiveness Hollywood",5
"  they did a wonderful job on the 3D,much better than i expected",5
  My all time favorite fantasy movie.,5
  Probably the greatest children's movie of all time. Great story and use of set pieces (before cgi fucked up everything). Judy Garland was placed on the map with this gem. Margaret Hamilton steels the show as the wicked witch of the west.,5
"  Loved every second if it. A classic story, a classic message, remastered on Abigail screen.",5
  This movie was really enjoyable on the big IMax screen. I recommend seeing it while you can. The 3D effect were ok. It didn't enhance or change the movie but it did give some parts a sense of depth.,4
"  If you are a true Wizard fan this movie in IMAX will bring you joy, excitement, and tears. Very well done! I rate it a 10... And, get this, I missed Judy sing ""Rainbow"" and the Tornado."" I entered the theater just as the house fell to the ground, before Dorothy opened the door. The Haunted Forrest, Poppy Fields, and Witches Castle were awesome. I thought I was on stage with Judy Garland and the rest of the cast. Now I could say ""I saw the Wizard of Oz"" at the movie theater. Great Once In A Lifetime Experience ....",0
"  Judy and I went to see this magical movie in IMAX 3D on Monday. We both have seen the movie many, many times. I have never before in all those times noticed all the detail I saw on Monday. I truly was like seeing it for the first time. It is a very limited engagement but see it if you can. You will not be sorry.",5
  this is your brain on drugs..,2
  its rlly good I see it to many and cant stop,5
  Always a pleasure to see.,5
  When do we see the show times?,5
  A truly timeless American fairy tale that gets better with age.,5
"  Beautiful 3D conversion and remastering. Unlike anything I have seen before. So much depth and dimension to the 3D, do not miss out on this new version!",5
"  What a treat to see this classic rescued from the small screen abyss and put back on the big screen in dazzling glory, but far bigger than Victor Fleming could have possibly imagined! I wonder if the impact on me of seeing the film in IMAX 3D might have been similar to the experience of being at an original screening so many decades ago. Note: The Wicked Witch of the West's nose is a bit longer in 3D.",5
"  Oh, to be alive in 1939 and see it on the big screen. To see it on an IMAX screen is not so much to see it in 3D, but a chance to see it on any screen besides a television set. I have seen this film countless times on cable, but I was overwhelmed when the credits started rolling. Almost 75 years later, the film is beautifully restored and I felt like a kid again. The story, characters, and music are timeless and it is a film that will and should be passed down from generation to generation. What a treat to experience this in a dark theater full of people with the same love and affection. This film will never get old and as long as I keep watching it, neither will I.Grade: A+",5
  This was so intense! I was amazed at the things that I noticed which I could never see before! Highly recommend for all Oz fans!,5
  One of the best movies of all time. Period.,5
  If you're a Wizard of Oz fan I urge you to see this release in IMAX. It's only going to be on for a week.,5
  Gorgeous. Astonishing detail. Can't wait to see it again.,5
"  I somehow managed to miss the part about it being in 3D. WOW! Several of my swimmers went at the same time and the little ones loved it. The Flying Monkeys still scare little kids! One of the 10 yr olds said that the effects were so old, but they still looked cool. One of the girls said it was weird to hear the songs. She eventually said that there were understandable words and no cursing in the whole movie. She had never been to a ""grown up""movie with no cursing! She was surprised that she missed it!",5
"  No computer generated effects or animations, no stuntmen/stuntwomen for the main actors/actresses, no studio adjusted song audio, just pure amazing acting, singing, set design and script. It proves that true classic never have to be redone. IMAX 3D just enhanced the amazing movie it was, back in 1939. I can't wait for the IMAX 3D version of Ben Hur, from 1959, to be released.",5
"  This iconic triumph of Hollywood's golden age has never looked better, and the 3D/IMAX only enhances the magnificent production design. Well-worth seeing.",5
"  Absolutely wonderful in IMAX 3D. Felt like a little girl again watching her favorite movie, only on the BIG screen this time!!!",5
  There is good news to report. It works! The image and sound reprocessing bring this classic into the digital age and remain true to the original artistry. This is a loving restoration with clearly thousands of man-hours and computer rendenering hours to get something that feels true to how it might have felt to see so much color in 1939. this really must run for more than 1 week only before it goes into some Warner Bros vault.,4
"  Saw the Wizard of Oz early this morning in IMAX 3D. This film scared me as a small child, and I had nightmares then. I've probably seen the film as an adult several times since then (without fear), but the 3D IMAX experience completely blew me away. The Wizard of Oz was way ahead of its time in special effects, and I wonder if small children will still be affected with fear as I was as a child. This film is a must-see for both film buffs/historians and for nostalgic, sentimental film-goers like me. Yes, I cried several times as I watched.",5
"  An old time classic gets a re-release in I-MAX! Since I was a kid, I always loved The Wizard of Oz and I always will. It gives you that warm, happy, childish feeling when your watching it. The costumes and make up is great on all of the actors. This movie is really long but I liked the pacing of it. All of the characters had their own personalities and stories and they were all good. The acting and dialogue was really convincing and effective. I loved the plot, storyline, and lesson overall because it means so much. I liked the settings in Oz and how it transitioned to black and white to color. I also loved the songs and dances too. Overall, this is an old time, heartwarming movie that no one should miss. I really loved and enjoyed this movie!",5
  3D was beautifully done worth seeing....!,5
"  ""I DON'T THINK WE'RE IN KANSAS ANYMORE!"" SEE IT AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME. There simply aren't words adequate to describe the sheer joy, beauty and artistic majesty of this timeless classic. In what is an amazing technical triumph, The film has been brought to IMAX with a crisp brilliance. Visually, nothing has been lost and the modest 3d effect adds to the experience. There so much you don't see in this movie, unless you see it on the big screen. See it in a restored movie palace and, when the lights go down, close your eyes and pretend its 1939. Then open them to the opening credits and an age of American innocence that will be soon lost in a World War. Even so, never forget, ""there's no place like home"".",5
"  3D: 1/5The movie itself is and always will be a classic, however, it's useless in IMAX and usless in 3D (And I Love 3D). seeing a movie that has two black bars on the sides in IMAX makes it pointless.",4
"  What kind of joyless bastard doesn't like 'The Wizard of Oz'? I mean, seriously.",5
  Spectacular IMAX 3D further enhances what was already a certified masterpiece of cinema.,5
  Wizard of Oz..enough said!,4
"  What a good movie this is! I love this movies so much. The acting in this movie is so great. The score is masterpiece. If you never seen this movie before, go out an see it. THIS IS A MUST SEE!!!!!! Now I didn't seen this in 3D but I did have the DVD for this movie and this is one excellent classics of all time.",5
"  So good classy imagine story. if you love this mov, watching tin man 3 series movie too :).",5
"  The visual effects may be primative and dated compared to today's standards but nevertheless, The Wizard of Oz is still an impressive movie, with memorable characters, unforgettable songs (and God knows we tried to forget them!), and a classic story makes this masterpiece of filmmaking an absolute must-see for kids, adults, and especially movie lovers, and also if you can see it in IMAX 3D while it lasts!",4
  Only the best movie EVER!!!!!,5
  My 2nd IMAX 3d film and it was wonderful. Good acting and a great classic for anyone at any age. Good musical numbers and effects.,4
  I have loved this movie for so many years and it was just a joy to be able to see it on the big screen. I felt it was very well done and very clear and enjoyable as always. So grateful it was given new life and to see small children enjoying it like I did growing up.,4
"  Several minutes into the film, it dawned on me that I could not remember not having seen The Wizard of Oz. It has been a part of my consciousness for my entire 36 years. Yet, I had never seen it on the big screen. It allowed me to take better notice of the work that went into the set and the costumes. I am a cynical adult and I could not bring myself to think it was still anything but magical.",4
"  This film is too classic a tale, The wizard of Oz is the definition of a film Icon and movie magic.",5
"  The Wizard of Oz is legendary, it's a classic! The characters spend their time searching for a brain, a heart and courage, but this movie has all three. I'm so glad I can now say I saw this on the big screen, in IMAX 3D no less.",5
  A classic that never gets old. Loved it in IMAX,5
  the most overrated movie of all time,1
  Absolutely wonderful!,5
"  Very much enjoyed this big, vivid version of a classic film. The IMAX made a bigger difference than the 3D but the 3D Was well done. Worth the $16.25 , I enjoyed this!",4
"  Still a classic - just with much better clarity, sound and sights. Restored for 75th anniversary.",4
  IT was nice too see this movie in Imax. I looked at it like I never saw it before,5
"  Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland) is a teenager on a Kansas farm who daydreams about going ""over the rainbow."" Along with her house and her dog Toto (Terry), she's swept from her black-and-white world to the magical, beautiful, dangerous and technicolor land of Oz by a tornado. Dorothy's house lands on and kills the wicked witch who rules the Land of the Munchkins, little people who think at first that Dorothy herself must be a witch. The Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton), sister of the dead witch, threatens Dorothy. But Glinda (Billie Burke), the Good Witch of the North, gives Dorothy the dead witch's enchanted Ruby Slippers, and the slippers protect her. Glinda advises that if Dorothy wants to go home to Kansas, she should seek the aid of the Wizard of Oz, who lives in the Emerald City. To get there, Dorothy sets off down the Yellow Brick Road.Before she's followed the road very far, Dorothy meets a talking scarecrow whose dearest wish is to have a brain. Hoping that the wizard can help him, the Scarecrow (Ray Bolger) joins Dorothy on her journey. They come upon the Tin Woodman (Jack Haley), who longs for a heart; he too joins Dorothy. As they walk through a dense forest, they encounter the Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr), who wishes for courage and joins the quest in the hope that the wizard will give him some.",1
  the 3d was just perfect. it was nice to see Judy Garland and the cast all in 3d. and i tell ya Mila Kunis aged well lol.,5
"  What an awesome treat for kids old enough to see this! I'd love to take my grand-kids to see this...but alas, they aren't old enough yet.",5
"  Once again, here's a movie that got remade in 3-D that I've seen before so I'll again be talking about the movie when I saw it rather than the 3-D version. If you've seen my reviews before, you probably also are aware of how much I tend to like film less when they are put back in theaters with 3-D added to it and how I usually see this as a bad thing. So do I say the same about the Wizard of Oz? Well hold on to your shorts because this is one of the few films I actually am glad they put back in theaters. Sure the 3-D is unnecessary as always, but this film is so harmless, so innocent, and so close to flawless for its time that I don't see any harm in re-releasing the crap out of this film because it's one of those rare films that no matter what your age, upbringing, or view, you should at least watch at least once in your lifetime. I mean it, this movie is so hard to find any real flaw in, with only tiny rumors around it being the one tiny questionable thing about it. Another thing is that if a movie from so long ago still demands being seen after this many years, it really says something about the quality of the movie. For its time, it was a pretty amazing film and while the effects may not be as shiny these days, it stands out so much more and is so much better than a lot of things we see pop up into theaters. While Star Wars Ep. 1 had no reason to be re-released, and Titanic had very shaky ground on being re-released, the Wizard of Oz is a movie that can be re-released and still remain as a solid classic. Its got so much charm to it that it's hard to hate and it has enough of a gentle touch that its hard to find offense in it. After so many years, I don't see any reason not to go see this again. If you want to revisit the movie, bring the family along or even just watch a good classic, I don't see any wrong in going to the theaters again to watch this one.",4
  Why is dark Shadows got any rating?,5
"  Hypno-Vision, astounding, loving detail, see it or with ""The Dark Side of the Moon"" on 'phones.",5
  The ultimate classic must see and own movie!!,5
  One of my life long favorite movies. I can't wait to see it in imax 3d!,5
"  Musical, whimsical, and that damn twister still looks so real. Brings me back.",4

  a true classic ......... a must watch movie for every movie-lover,5
  Fantastic and timeless,0
"  Shows that even with today's special effects, nothing can match good casting and great storytelling.",5
"  The Wizard of Oz, simply put, is a pure delight to watch. With scares, laughs and catchy tunes, this film's the whole package, and it never gets lost in time.",4
  I still think this is a horrible movie.,1
"  For adults, a fresh retake on a glorious movie. For a new generation, a glimpse at an exceptional movie before all the CGI ""stuff"" !",5
  What can I say. A true American classic! A real piece of film history that will never die..,5
  Boy is this overrated and dated.,0
"  ""The Wizard Of Oz"" is as magical and amiable as it promises in an engaging fantasy adventure with a beautifully crafted setting and sharp plotting focus.",5
"  An absolute shit-pile whose mind-numbing visuals and poor storytelling are still every bit as terrible, The Wizard of Oz is a must-see film for absolutely no one.",1
  How awesome - a classic favorite in IMAX 3D!,0
  Who doesn't like this movie?,5
  was a good movie I liked the girl oz glued together,4
"  a classic hollywood film that delights not just kids, but the older generations as well. I am amazed that the picture holds up so well after 80 years, and say it came out in like the 50's, well then i wouldn't be quite as amazed. This one certainly deserves a perfect rating. Why did that one guy have to ruin it.",5
"  I hear they added Judy Garland singing ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" back. It was originally cut to keep the movie length shorter.",0
  Holy cow so excited!,0
  Just one of the best movie musicals ever made.,0
  Predicted Rating: 4/4.5,0
  A classic. The IMAX 3D was good. Imagine it was difficult to convert to 3D but nicely done.,5
"  I have lost all respect for critics and rotten tomatoes as well, this is just wrong...",0
"  What better way to spend a Sunday morning for this non-Charger fan than to see an advance screening of a 75 year old classic film (believe it or not the woman behind me in line had never seen the movie - gay sacrilege) presented in 3D IMAX on the big screen. Of course you won't need to rush out & see it, I understand it will soon be available for sale in 3D Blueray format.",4
"  Re-released in 3D and Imax, no Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon soundtrack. :(",4
  The best movie ever made! The hard life if the 1930's to a magical land that is both scary and extremely funny. I have seen this movie more than 50 times and it never gets old.,4
  one of the most memorable and importsnt films ever made.,4
  [i]The Wizard of Oz [/i]is a fantastic effort at making a movie. Difference between today's big budget and those from sixty years ago are today the scripts and plots are pathetic. This movie can be enjoyed by all age and perhaps led way for musicals to be made into films. Judy Garland is amazing as Dorothy.,4
  Old time best! Loved it as a kid and still love it now,5
  3D for you and your little dog too!,4
"  It's one of the most beloved movies of all time for a reason. I feel if I don't give it a high rating, I'm an indecent human being.",5
"  ""I am Oz, the Great and Powerful!""  In 1939, director Victor Fleming created two Technicolor masterpieces in the same year; The Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind. The first release, The Wizard of Oz, remains to this day a cinematic masterpiece and one of the greatest movies of all-time.  Based on the book by L Frank Baum, The Wizard of Oz tells the story of Kansas farmgirl Dorothy (Judy Garland), who longs to go over the rainbow with her dog Toto into a better place. When a tornado sends them to the Land of Oz, Dorothy enjoys her life there until it's discovered that her house killed the Wicked Witch of the East, and her sister, the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton), wants revenge. With the help of Glinda the Good Witch (Billie Burke), Dorothy sets out to the Emerald City to ask the Wizard of Oz (Frank Morgan) to send her back home.  Along the way, Dorothy teams up with The Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), who has no brains, The Tinman (Jack Haley), who longs for a heart, and The Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr), who lacks courage, to get to the wizard to get what they need. But the Wicked Witch, still sore about Dorothy's unintentional killing of her sister, sets out with her flying monkeys to kill Dorothy and her companions before they meet the Great and Powerful Oz.  One of the reasons why The Wizard of Oz worked so well is how the film was set up. The Kansas scenes were filmed in black-and-white, while the scenes in Oz were filmed in Technicolor. When Dorothy opens the door and enters the colorful Oz for the first time, you know that the film would be special.  The visuals still remain impressive for a 70-year plus old film. From Dorothy's enterance to Oz, to the apperance of the flying monkeys, Victor Fleming manages to put in that magic spark in order to make Oz the most believable, even if the film was set on a studio backlot.  Also, the film succeeds in its cast and characters. Margaret Hamilton is evil and menacing as the witch, and has some pretty memorable lines (""I'll get you my pretty, and your little dog too."") Jack Haley is an entertaining Tin Man, Ray Bolger is fun and memorable as the Scarecrow, and Buurt Lahr is hilarious as the Cowardly Lion. Frank Morgan, who plays the wizard, is also a treat to watch, especially when we find out who the wizard really is (""Pay no attention to the man behind this curtain!"")  But it's Judy Garland's performance as Dorothy that really makes the film worthwhile. When she misses her home in Kansas, you feel for her and root for her when she hits her difficult challenges. Toto the dog is also a memorable character, and is extremely well-trained.  While keeping the adventuros fantasy elements in the book, The Wizard of Oz is also a musical. Many of the songs are pretty fun for a musical, and adds depth to the characters in the film. Judy Garland gives me goosebumps when she sings the most famous song, ""Over the Rainbow."" She sounds like a doll and provides one of Hollywood's greatest songs. There's also ""The Munchkin Song"", performed by the Munchkins, which features some catchy tunes. The four main characters perform another well-known classic, which is only one chorus, called ""We're Off to See the Wizard"", which is an instant stuck-in-your head song. The cast performs ""The Wonderful Land of Oz"" when arriving in Oz, and is another highlight in the film. Bert Lohr, The Cowardly Lion, performs the hilarious and memorable ""If I Were the King of the Forrrrresttttttttttttt!"", which is very funny and gives everyone a good laugh no matter how old you are.  There is nothing more for me to say. The Wizard of Oz is one of the greatest films of all-time and remains one of the best films to watch with your family, even if the fling monkeys have scarred many kids for life. It's still G-rated though.  ""There's no place like home.""",5
"  It's a n all time classic, a heart filled adventure with colourful characters and a witch that will probably scare the crap out of children of a certain age.",5
"  I'm not a fan of musicals, so I was surprised I liked this at all",4
"  Ah, nostalgia. The Wizard of Oz shook Hollyood, and 70 plus years later still holds a special place in so many hearts. The songs and sets still dazzle, and Dorothy's journey still warms the heart.",5
"  I know it makes me a hipster bastard to not like a movie you're supposed to like by virtue of it's being a Timeless Classic^(TM), but the storytelling in this makes absolutely no sense. There is no rhyme or reason to anything at all whatsoever. I appreciate that it's a positive and good-natured spectacle-driven blockbuster, but that doesn't mean it's not a spectacle-driven blockbuster. If you think this was any less money-grubbing than Raimi's Oz The Great And Powerful, y'all naive. All that being said, Frank Morgan is phenomenally droll, his performance is hilarious.",2
  Greatest movie ever!,5
  one of the best movies of all time!,5
"  The first color movie, this is a well known classic and for good reason. The story and acting is quite wonderful, but the characters give it a zing.",4
  I love this movie there's no place like home and I also saw this on ice too. I also like the flying monkeys.,4
  Such a classic. A wonderful movie.,5
  A classic musical that creates magic and beauty.,5
"  I know it's a classic, but I haaate it.",1
  I'm just wandering why Dorothy will miss Scarecrow the most.,4
"  Yes, it can be incredibly campy and silly, and the plot can sometimes be quite sketchy, but it's full of wonderful moments. The acting is great, and the characters are just delightful in a classic way. One thing I really like is the contrasting tones. The scenes set in Kansas are in a sepia tone, which conveys the familiar and unequivocally bland environment that it was when the film was made, while the scenes set in the land of Oz are in colour, which conveys a whimsical and exotic fantasy world. I'm normally averse to musicals, but the musical numbers here have enough charm that they're actually quite enjoyable. Overall, it's one of the most cherished movies of all time, and rightfully so, because it's an enjoyable fantasy film for all the family.",4
"  It was a really great family musical classic. It had very well done cinematography, great characters, very fun songs, very exciting adventure, very well done locations, really great costumes, very great makeup, very well done cast, and a great storyilne. It's one of my favorite family classics from my childhood. I would really recommend this movie to both children and adults.",5
  visually enchanting. except the flying monkeys.,4
"  Groudbreaking and cheering. The most beautiful movie of all time, rare and colorful. The amazing combination of fantasy and music make it unique and a real treasure that keeps us young if its magic is understood.",5
  Beautiful timeless classic.,5
"  We're off to see the wizard, the adequately entertaining, but somewhat dated and narratively thin 'Wizard of Oz'!"" Yeah, they might be giving this film a bit more credit than it deserves just for being old, as well as innovative for its time, even when it comes to tone, because, let me tell you, when I was a kid, even I got kind of freaked out by the flying monkeys, and in 1939, I bet that they left the grown men stuttering like the Cowardly Lion for the next couple Judy Garland films, though that may have just been Garland's legs after she got good and grown up. It's good that she had that going for her after this film, because she was cuter at 16, and if you think that that's kind of weird to say, this film is so old that I think that it came out at a time when 16-year-olds were already married, with children, and a place in the Senate of the Roman Empire or something. No, this film can't possibly be that terribly old, because I had always figured that the '60s was the best time to get the type of dope which just had to have gone into this film, or at least into the minds of this film's viewers back in 1939. Man, this trippy flick has always been mighty popular, and I'm betting Victor Fleming was glad of that, because if I'm going to make time to knock something the same year I did ""Gone with the Wind"", I better get paid back well. Man, forget Fleming, this film and ""Gone with the Wind"" bled Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer dry, so if they didn't succeed, Fleming would have his life to worry about more than his money (He made this film and ""Gone with the Wind"" in one year, so it's not like he had all that much time to spend on having a life). Well, lucky for MGM, 1939 was anything but the year they saw flop, because this film and its fellow Fleming flick were quite the hit, though that's not to say that this film comes close to the level of ""Gone with the Wind"", being held back by a number of factors.  A late 1930s family fluff piece, this film has, of course, dated quite a bit over the years, though it couldn't have been entirely cleansed of cheesiness at the time of its release, and it's certainly not cleansed of corniness now, as its lighter moments get to be too fluffy for their own good, sometimes to a slightly annoying extent, and when it comes to the deeper areas of this film's substance, it's also dated, with no subtlety and only so much weight. Sure, I wouldn't have expected too much from this film back in '39, so I'm certainly not asking for all that much depth to this classic fluff flick, but it's all so very superficial, and all too often to a cheesy extent which challenges your investment about as much as dating within pacing sensibilities. At just over 100 minutes, the film is both rather short on a general level, as well as longer than it probably should be, and you are reminded of this by a certain unevenness in pacing, whose more hurried moments slam-bang exposition, and whose less swift areas get to be a bit carried away in repetitious padding. Really, pacing inconsistency isn't a terribly big problem, or at least the slow spells are not nearly as frequent as the hurried spells, but it still stands, messing with the momentum of the film's focus until you end up with plotting that kind of takes longer than it probably should to tell a story so simple. Again, pacing issues aren't considerable, and while cheesiness is, it's a bit easier to forgive, considering the fact that this fluff piece was done quite a while back, so as far as consequential shortcomings are concerned, not much is wrong with this film, which is still kind of underwhelming, largely thanks to natural shortcomings, because as much fun as this tale may be, there's nothing much to it. This classic fluff piece really is not much more than a classic fluff piece, and that's fine and all, as it makes for some pretty entertaining classic cinema, but at the end of the day, without its historical significance and fair deal of still-memorable strength, there wouldn't be too much to remember within this somewhat cheesy, uneven and limited piece of fantasy fare. That being said, even without taking its historical significance into consideration, this film is an enjoyable one, whose shortcomings are undeniable, but challenged enough by aspects which were groundbreaking at the time and are still impressive now, with musical aspects being particularly strong against the test of time.  By no means was Herbert Stothart's score especially groundbreaking at the time, or especially outstanding, but to this day it is undeniably quite strong, with a classical tastefulness and color which flavor up entertainment value, especially when bonded with sharp lyrics by Harold Arlen and lively vocals in order to produce one delightful musical number after a while. Whether when it's complimenting tone with tasteful score work or flavoring up the fun factor with justly legendary songs, the musical aspects cannot be taken away from this film, bringing life to its world every bit as much as Cedric Gibbons', George Gibson's, Wade B. Rubottom's and Elmer Sheeley's art direction, which certainly raises a standard, for although some of the film's designs have become dated, whether they be production designs by Malcolm Brown, William A. Horning and Jack Martin Smith, or costume designs by Adrian, the components into the making of this film's distinct world still hold up as colorfully intricate and eminently memorable, especially when their beauty is really fleshed out by Harold Rosson's cinematography. Needless to say, Rosson's efforts have become quite dated over the years, but you have appreciate them for their uniqueness for the time, and for their still being quite impressive on the whole, with a handsomely grainy bronze tone to the first act that often resembles some kind of a tastefully done old photography, while the Technicolor-charged body of the film bounces the rich depths of color in a striking way that is still eye-catching to this day. Technically and stylistically, the film hasn't made it through the test of time spotless, but the visuals which do a lot to drive this fluff piece remain nothing short of remarkable, and you just cannot see this film without them, partially because the film doesn't have too much going for it when it comes to substance. The film may be stylistically strong, but it has only so much to offer when it comes to story weight, and even then, this timeless tale is by no means terribly unengaging, because it's so distinctly unique, as well as colorful at its core, particularly when it comes to presenting exceptionally memorable characters, brought to life by colorful performances, many of which have become rather dated as kind of hammy, but not so much so that you can't see the charm within most every member of this cast, especially show-stealingly delightful secondary leads Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and, last but not at all least, Bert Lahr. A young Judy Garland is fine and all, but Bolger's, Haley's and Lahr's color do more than you'd expect in bringing this fun flick to life, and yet, the performance that really drives the entertainment value of this fluff piece is a certain offscreen one by Victor Fleming, whose boastful atmosphere does thin subtlety no favors, but also adds much to the kick of tonal heights in storytelling, while keeping consistent in thorough entertainment value. No matter what the nostalgic critics may say, you shouldn't expect much from this film, and sure enough, the final product doesn't offer all that much reward value, but it does offer much entertainment value, anchored by heartfelt storytelling, flavored up by a colorful style, and ultimately abundant enough to make a very fun, if flawed fluff classic.  When it's time to go the way of Elton John and bid goodbye to the Yellow Brick Road, underwhelmingness stands supported by cheesy dating, pacing unevenness and, worst of all, a thinness in subject matter weight which is considerable enough for the final product to fall quite a ways short of truly rewarding, and yet, through a delightful soundtrack, exceptional art direction, lively cinematography and an at least colorful story concept, brought to life about as much as it can by charismatic performances - particularly from Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr - and upbeat directorial storytelling, Victor Fleming's ""The Wizard of Oz"" is left to stand as an improvable, but fun fluff piece of cinema's golden age.  2.5/5 - Fair",4

"  No one can go wrong with watching a classic film every once in a while. To me, the quintessential example of classic cinema is ""The Wizard of Oz."" Its gleeful characters, joyful music, groundbreaking sets, and pure gaiety make it one for generations upon generations of children and adults alike to enjoy, not to mention its revolutionary and vibrant cinematography. Anyone can hum at least one of the infectious tunes that the film so effortlessly displays. ""The Wizard of Oz"" also gives audiences a chance to enter the remarkable land of Oz and change for the better, just as young Dorothy did. It lets people of any age to discover a younger self, a child within, to rekindle with. Sometimes, all one needs is to escape any harsh reality they live in, and locate a wholesome innocence that lies within to have fun and enjoy themselves. ""The Wizard of Oz"" allows for just this.",5
  Best movie ever made,5
"  It's a classic, you can't not enjoy it.",4
  Just watched the blu ray release of this wonderful masterpiece and it's a real eye opener when we see films these days spending massive budgets unnecessarily and this is a great example of how you can make a great film on a smaller budget. The actors and actresses are brilliant and so are the sets. This is one of those movies everyone must see. The story flows well and it will keep you hooked.,5
"  Where to begin? MGM's elaborate adaptation of L. Frank Baum's 1900 fantasy classic THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ not only became an institution among itself (and practically defined the concept of modern popular culture), but is reported to be the most viewed film ever made. A sharp screenplay effectively condenses the novel's text into a workable film, and director Victor Fleming (along with countless other behind-the-scenes technicians) craft a visually stimulating fantasy world that surpasses the expectations of even the most imaginative viewers. Brimming with stunning visual effects (the film's fierce tornado is an FX feat that has yet to be surpassed by CGI), witty dialogue, and eye-popping Technicolor, THE WIZARD OF OZ truly lives up to it's reputation as a once-in-a-lifetime film where every element comes together flawlessly.The cast could not be improved upon. The quivery-voiced, solemn-faced Judy Garland will always be Dorothy, the little lost farm girl on the road to Oz, clutching her beloved Toto (impressively portrayed himself by the female canine performer Terry, the terrier). It seems inconceivable that MGM had originally wished to cast Shirley Temple in the role, as Temple's doe-eyed, cutesy-voiced shtick would have been a catastrophic ill-fit for the tone of this picture. Conversely, Garland is perhaps the screen's quintessential woman/child; always seemingly just one step away from reaching full emotional maturity. It is her sadness that transfixes viewers to the screen, the exact same quality that made the film's most memorable Harold Arlen/E. Y. Harburg number ""Over the Rainbow"" into one of the most exquisite marriages between artist and song ever to be recorded.The remainder of the cast is similarly exceptional, many of whom perform perfectly even under the most debilitating make-up and costumes. Frank Morgan is marvelously versatile in no less than five roles, the insanely energetic Bert Lahr mugs brilliantly, the handsome Jack Haley swoons sweetly, Billie Burke lends the film an ornate ethereality, and Ray Bolger's gravity-defying physical presence nearly steals the entire picture on several occasions. Perhaps most notable is former schoolteacher Margaret Hamilton's transformation into the wickedest of wicked witches, which certainly remains among the vilest and most terrifying portrayals of full-throttle evil ever to be seen. No matter how it is analyzed, scrutinized, or satirized, the 1939 production of THE WIZARD OF OZ is a top-notch example of how to turn a great story into a fabulous, milestone of a film.",5

"  ""There is no place like home.""A classic film that people will hate it easily today due to those costumes,over acting,annoying musics,no spectacular CGS or visuals and bla bla bla..ah...who cares!!For me,this is the film that most of the filmmakers and song writers should learn it today,stop the fan-service.Yes,those little creatures sounds stupid but the costumes(call me old cow),the colorful smokes,direction and backgrounds made me smile.Truly one of the Hollywood's classics though it's not my favorites,I'm sure if you are old school adorer,try it.Hate it or Love it.:)",4
"  This little known, small indie film was definitely ahead of its time when it premiered in 1939. It's a lot of fun, with catchy songs, and harrowing scenes of a devastating tornadoes and flying apes. It's also mostly in color, which is cool. The best thing about it though? It's the first film to feature a munchkin in a main role (Mayor of Munchkin City, played with fevered but measured exuberance by the late great Billy Bletcher.) I can't recommend this enough. I only warn that you watch it when your children are away or sleeping...there's nothing about this fantasy that is kid-friendly.",4

  What started great films.,5
"  I have a theory that this movie has probably been seen by more people than any other movie. The fact that it comes to us as children is probably the reason why. Other films like 'Gone With the Wind', 'Citizen Kane', 'The Godfather', 'Star Wars', have been seen by a lot of people but in each case I can imagine people that might not have seen them. In the case of 'The Wizard of Oz' it's hard to imagine anyone who might not have seen it at some point in their lives. Almost everyone you talk to has a memory of their first experience. The reason this movie remains the most beloved of Hollywood films even after six decades is because 'The Wizard of Oz' is unique among motion pictures in that it mirrors our longings and imaginations as children.The movie, in front of and behind the scenes, has become movie folklore. We love the legends about the rotating directors, from George Cukor to King Vidor to Victor Fleming. We know the legend of Buddy Ebsen who had to drop out due to an allergic reaction to the Tin Man makeup and Margaret Hamilton whose dress caught fire and nearly had her face burned off because of the copper-based make-up. We love stories about the problems on the set between personal feuds, sweltering costumes, partying munchkins and the costume designer who had to keep up with Judy Garland's developing bust line. There's even a spurious legend of a ghost on the set. All of these elements make 'The Wizard of Oz' a much bigger legend than it already it, but that's okay because this is the one movie that deserves to be over-hyped. It occupies such a large part of our memories that we want to make it more than it is, to just have one more reason to make it more than a movie, we want it to be a life experience.That experience is brought to us because we are intimately familiar with its story elements. The dreams that Dorothy sings about and the adventure that follows seem to mirror our yearnings as children. She imagines a bigger place where her problems don't linger and she is free to explore them. She imagines a place where there isn't any trouble and people actually listen to what she has to say. She sees the rainbow as her golden gate to a better place because in her drab Kansas world, the rainbow is the only source of color that she knows. She dreams of a bigger place and imagines a world where troubles melt like lemondrops. We can relate. How many of us as kids sat in our room or in our yards and played, imagining a place to go and characters to interact with, a colorful world bigger than our small, confined worlds.Oz is meant to represent the colorful palette of our imagination but for Dorothy it is also a place where she does some growing up. The three friends that she meets along the way, The Scarecrow, The Tin Man and The Lion are emblematic of the lessons of bravery, love and devotion and the ability to think for ourselves. The Wicked Witch of the West certainly represents the real dangers along the way. For Dorothy there is a matronly figure, Glinda the Good Witch who intends for Dorothy to discover for herself how to solve her problems, she knows that Dorothy must grow up along the way. In a way, she seems to represent the parent that Dorothy doesn't have back in Kansas. Her aunt and uncle love her but this was a movie made during the depression and we imagine the climate that they live in, where work means keeping the farm. No work = no farm = no home.For 1939, Dorothy was the perfect character for young girls. She echoes many of the small town country girls who, in the midst of the depression, packed their suitcases and ran to Hollywood seeking fame and fortune in the movies. For them this film is a cautionary tale that they'd be better off if they just stayed home. Judy Garland was perfect in the role, 17 at the time, but with wide-eyes and a beautiful, open face she carries that sense of wonderment of a child. Like most of us as children, her only true companion is a dog named Toto and the most frightening moment in the film is when she is nearly robbed of her best friend. When she sings 'Over the Rainbow' we know that it's to escape an unhappy childhood (she has apparently lost her parents) and for Garland we identify. She began in show business as a kiddie act with her sisters and began her long movie career when she was only 13. She was already a familiar face from 'Love Finds Andy Hardy' and by the time of 'Oz' she was already under contract to MGM. That she was familiar to audiences helped her in the role. That familiarity works well with her ability to project the vulnerability and melancholy that the character has to have. We have to believe that she will become frightened and that her life will be in danger because if she doesn't that we sense that the character can work her way out of the situation herself and our interest wanes.If movies are a time capsule than 'The Wizard of Oz' wonderfully captures a brief moment of happiness in Garland's life. We know of her problems with studio execs that put her through an exhausting schedule and used drugs to get her going in the morning then put her to sleep at night. We know the legends of her mental and physical problems that dogged her most of her life but 'The Wizard of Oz' sees her at a moment in her life when it all seemed perfect, just as her star was rising and before her problems really began. There's poignancy in that, and that's why I think that the casting of Shirley Temple in the role would have been a mistake. By 1939, Temple was the biggest star in the world her presence in the film would have been too much, she would have stood out and we would only seen Shirley Temple, not Dorothy Gale.Garland's presence allows the story a certain credibility. I have tried to imagine that famous dance down the Yellow Brick Road with a 4 foot child and it just doesn't fit.If Garland gives the film its center than I think the production design, awe-inspiring in 1939, is the perfect backdrop. In these early musicals filmed on a soundstage it isn't hard to spot where the soundstage ends. Some have seen that as a flaw but I think it adds to the dreamlike quality of the film. The matte paintings behind the sets add to the storybook quality. The fact that we're in a dream makes it okay that the special effects look a little hasty. That was the genius of the screenplay, that and to establish the Oz characters as characters that Dorothy meets in Kansas. In our dreams we often see people and events that have recently occurred in our lives, but this is the first time I've ever seen it expressed in a movie. In particular is the notion that Professor Marvel keeps showing up as various characters in the dream.What generosity the filmmakers had. What ingenuity to create this entire world that is colorful and beautiful and scary. What depth of character they created. What messages they send. This is a movie constructed with loving care. We're told that those who worked on the film just thought of this as just another movie, but when I watch the film I find that hard to believe. Certainly from the screenwriters. I wonder if they saw how brilliantly they were tapping our frustrations and our excitement, our dreams, our need and our sense of wonderment. I wonder if they knew the impact of what they were working on, that the lovely sentiments that they created would still resonate 60 years later. I wonder if they knew that their heart's desires weren't that far from our own.",5
"  My early plan to watch Sam Raimi's OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL (2013) has been successfully foiled by the tepid reviews and in fear of another ALICE IN WONDERLAND (2010, 6/10) travesty, then it stroke to me that I had never even watched the worldly-famous 1939 version, it must be a presumably safe and better alternative. I'm indisputably way past the age which will be exalting to watch this family-friendly vaudeville for the very first time, I wish I could have done that around my childhood year so I would be more in shock-and-awe admiration for this haute crowd-pleaser and ground-breaking studio-based product. It all begins in Kansas, young Dorothy lives in a farm with his uncle and auntie, (after a melancholic rendition of OVER THE RAINBOW, still astounding and flawless) her tentative runaway with her cuddly puppy Toto has been persuaded by Professor Marvel (a very first introduction of multi-personae performance from Frank Morgan), en route, a twister rampages the farm and Dorothy and Toto (along with the house) has been brought to Wizard Oz's wonderland with the casualty of a star-crossed wicked witch (crushed by the house accidentally), and the shoddy superimposition of the airborne journey may be cutting-edge 74 years earlier, sadly it barely works even under an uncritical eye.  The tangible visual transference from sepia farmland to the variegated Oz land grants a soothing refreshment and heralds a jovial adventure ahead, sing-a-longs with DING DONG THE WITCH IS DEAD (new entry at No. 2 in this week at UK Singles Chart in the wake of Thatcher's death), it is just carefree and mollifying one's hard-pressed nerves (if you have those). Then the classic characters (Scarecrow, Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion) successively accompany Dorothy to meet the great and mighty Oz.  Despite of its all-comprising industry-reeking indoor design, it is a marvel how the film could be made in such a laborious scale and obedient order at its time, entering the second half of the film, when insouciant singing-and-dancing gives its way to the escapade of taking back the broomstick of The Wicked Witch of the West, all the set pieces are incontrovertibly stale and the logic of the story sags into an untenable farce (no specific elucidation of how the witch would succumb to a basin of water or what is so special about the red shoes the witch is hankering for, et al). The guarded-gate of the witch's castle must be the recipient of the homage from Sauron's gate from THE LORD OF THE RINGS.Acting-wise, Judy Garland is humble, mawkish but naturalistic in delivering jejune lines, Bert Lahr's Lion and Ray Bolger's Scarecrow otherwise are the film's best offers, also Margaret Hamilton's heinous witch, simply wish she had more venom to spill. Overall, it is a cartoon-ish adaption of children's best-known bedtime story, may be predisposed to be an overrated sensation which stands flimsily after a serious filmic anatomy, but the bent of director Victor Fleming and his crew has been testified positively through the arduous endeavour, and one can still relish 75-or-so years after its inception.",4
  Great classic right here!,4
  Absolutely wonderful in every way. A gold standard in family entertainment.,5
  I honestly never liked this one at all.,1
"  Brilliant simple as that, prefect acting, direction, and writing all around; a true classic.",5
"  My mother recalls when she was a child, and the Wizard of Oz would be shown on television once a year during the Thanksgiving season. It was such a big event that schools would let out, and people would take off work just to go home, make a big dinner, and watch The Wonderful Wizard of Oz with their family. The impact that this one film truly shows how movies touch lives, change hearts, and reach out to create emotions. In our modern society, seeing such crap being produced all the time, it is a comfort to know that kids are still being touched by one film that will never grow old.",5
  The Wizard of Oz is the best movie the classic with Judy Garland Ray Bolger and Marbley Hamilton are the best this is a true classic The new movie with Oz the great and powerful with James Franco is not going to be a classic And not popular,5
  A classic and the greatest musical of all time!,5

  The best classic film in history.,5
"  The songs sicken my soul now, but it was cool as a kid!",2
  ahhh yes wizard of oz love it love it love it!! everytime i went round ma nans i wud always watch it so dey ended up buyin it 4 me haha :P XD,5
  An iconic classic that deserves the highest praise for setting the foundation for many other great films. It's stunning color feature creates many eye popping scenes and beautifully accentuates the already memorable characters.,5
"  My grandmother enjoyed watching Garland, my mother and I used to enjoy watching the monkies, my son enjoy now a day when Dorothy sings ""Over the rainbow"".The Wizard of Oz is not a deep story as Citizine Kane or The Birth of a Nation but the fact that generations love that movie, makes it inmortal.",4
  Classic family film.,5

  Great Movie Watching Right Now in Cartoon Network 1939 One The Best xD,4
  Incredible and a wonderful classic!!,5
  Classic and almost unbeatable,5
  If you have not seen this film then your parents have fundamentally failed as parents. If you have not seen this film you have had a deprived childhood. If you have not enjoyed the wonderfully upbeat musical numbers and the brilliantly over acted characters and the impeccably crafted colorful sets then you have not enjoyed the wonders that cinema has offered us.,5
"  Simply one of the best movies around, and it will be as long as there's a shred of child left in you. Oh, and Otis Ferguson (""Top"" critic) can tell his boss Palpatine to stop calling it the New Republic and finally start calling it the Sith Empire instead.",5
  Great classic. ( trivia moment: It is a little known fact that this movie is a remake of a 1925 silent film by laurel and Hardy),4
"  Did you really expect any other rating, people?",5
"  ""There's no place like home."" Do I even need to say anymore? This classic film is iconic in every way and a family favorite in nearly every household. PLOT:Young Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland) is a farm girl living in the grey plains of Kansas with her Aunt Em (Clara Blandick) and Uncle Henry (Charles Grapewin). Even though she's a young girl, she dreams big of traveling the lands before her. However, a tornado comes along and sweeps her house up with her and Toto, her little dog, inside. The house comes down in the town of Munchkinland in the wonderful land of Oz. To find her way back home, she has to find the wizard in the Emerald City while avoiding the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton), who's out to get her for dropping a house on her sister. On the way, she meets a Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), a Tin Woodsman (Jack Haley), and a Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr), who choose to accompany her on her journey to see the wizard, wanting a brain, a heart, and courage in return. It's a great plot executed brilliantly. ACTING:The performances in here were really good. Judy Garland played an innocent and iconic role as the young farm girl, Dorothy. Playing well off her and each other, Jack Haley, Ray Bolger, and Bert Lahr performed excellent, iconic roles as the Scarecrow, Tin Woodsman, and Cowardly Lion. I favored Bert Lahr out of the trio, for his performance doubled comedically as it did iconically. Margaret Hamilton also played a great part as the Wicked Witch of the West. She still seems menacing today. The other shiners would be Clara Blandick as Aunt Em, Charles Grapewin as Uncle Henry, Billie Burke as Glinda the Good Witch, Frank Morgan as The Wizard of Oz, and all of the munchkins. There really wasn't a bad performance in here. SCORE:The musical score and soundtrack for this film are iconic, memorable, and catchy to sing as well as to hear. Everybody knows a song from it, whether it's ""We're Off to See the Wizard"", ""Ding-Dong the Witch is Dead"", or even ""If I Only Had a Brain."" Everybody knows the catchy soundtrack to this film. EFFECTS:The effects were astounding back in their time and are still very colorful today. The best effect at the time would have to have been the dramatic and iconic change from sepia/grayscale to Technicolor. That was a dazzling change for people back then and is still a prominent mark in film history. The prop effects were pretty colorful, and the more digital effects (such as the fireballs and the bubbles) were pretty interesting. The effects overall back then were pretty top-notch, but they still stand as interesting to watch now. OTHER CONTENT:This film is iconic on so many levels. Everybody has either seen or heard of the Wizard of Oz, and it's a family favorite for the young children and the older adults. Comparing it to the original book, the film seems to be based only loosely on it. However, this film adaptation improved it from its book form. Everything about this film is really perfect for its time and loveable even today. OVERALL,an epic film with a brilliant plot, really good performances, catchy score and soundtrack, colorful effects, and an iconic legacy left for filmgoers everywhere.",5

"  ""The Wizard of Oz"" is a timeless, wonderful film with great special effects and makeup, memorable songs, great choreography and a fun, playful story. Whether you're young or old, it's sure to put a smile on your face and if you haven't sat down and seen it for a while, you'll be surprised at how much you enjoy it. It doesn't matter that the movie was made more than 70 years ago, it's still just as fresh as it was when it was first released. (Theatrical version on the big screen, August 22, 2012)",5
"  this movie is the BEST! except, i think they need to remake it because it is soo fake!",4
  Just love this movie.,4
  I love this movie I watched every night when I was little and I can never get tired of this amazing movie so you should go see it today and enjoy it with family and friends or just By yourself,5
"  Having just read L. Frank Baum's book ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" and subsequently watching the classic 1939 MGM film, I thought I'd do a review of the movie.First of all, let me say that I thoroughly enjoyed Baum's book and I can see why it is a classic and the source of so many adaptations. That said, the 1939 film really takes this source material to a new level. The problem with Baum's book is that it is a series of episodes that, on its own in written form weaves a magical tale. But, if one imagines the story filmed exactly as is, I believe you'd see a rather slow and, at times, cumbersome film. The writers and filmmakers of ""The Wizard of Oz"" take the best of Baum's original work and create a narrative that has drama and intrigue.Whereas in the book the Wicked Witch of the West really only appears in a few chapters and is really only a threat to the Wizard, the movie creates a real enemy for not only the people of Oz, but for Dorothy and Company. She appears throughout the film constantly watching and trying to foil Dorothy's attempt to get to the Wizard. One of the best examples of a change from the book is that it's the Wicked Witch who casts a spell on the poppies to make Dorothy and the Lion fall asleep. Glinda, who's also monitoring the situation, gives them a little help, allowing them to escape. In the book, Dorothy and the Lion fall asleep because that's what poppies do and they end up getting rescued by a bunch of field mice. While its fun to read about the field mice, in a film situation, it is much more compelling to see this little bout between good versus evil.Another big change that the film makes from the book is connecting Kansas to Oz. Several of the characters Dorothy meets are based on the people in her life. She is protected in Oz by the same people who help protect her as farm hands on Uncle Henry's and Auntie Em's farm. And, moreso, she is threatened by somebody who suspiciously looks like the Wicked Witch of the West. It's a brilliant storytelling device.Finally, one cannot fail to mention all the classic music involved. ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"" is not only one of the most memorable songs of not only the film, but of all time. The songs are very much characters in the film that also help move the story along in a way that is fun and capture the spirit of Oz.I've always loved this film, but, after having read the book, it really makes me appreciate the film in a much greater way than I have before.",5
  Classical and timeless to all ages. The Wizard of Oz tells a reflecting story and their visual works is masterpiece and ground breaking at their own time.,4
  Why isn't this 100 percent?,0
"  This film is one of the most quintessential classics of cinema. Chances are that you've seen it aired every Thanksgiving, or you've seen clips of it all over the place, of you've heard the songs sung and resung, or you've seen parodies. The Wizard of Oz has become so ingrained in American culture that the film, its scenes, its characters, its music, its dialogue, and just about everything is instantly recognizable and endearing.To be perfectly honest, this is a really short and silly film. The comedy, especially with so many silly lines, is still hilarious to this day. There is peril and adventure in short bursts, and such scenes have become seriously iconic. Frequently catchy musical numbers add to the overall whimsey of the picture. There's hardly a dull moment in this film, and most moments are memorable and fun.The story is a short and simple affair. It takes a stretch to believe something this fantastic, but the film plays things so straight that it successfully immerses the audience. Characters aren't terribly deep or fleshed-out, but they stand out really well. In the end, it's the themes that count. On one hand, it's a fundamental fantasy adventure: the classic there-and-back-again tale, in which the characters embark on their journey and come back stronger and wiser. With the film's ending, such themes are made even stronger, when it's revealed that it may have all been in Dorothy's dream. The big reveal for the actual wizard of Oz is also a thematically strong moment, as it underscores a key theme regarding magic and imagination; it's a theme that not only extends to the characters of the story, but also reaches beyond the screen and demonstrates movie-making magic on a fundamental level. If there's any thematic weakness, it's purely in the very very end, when Dorothy concludes that it's much better to stay at home than it is to have an adventure (she almost makes it sound like she'll be a recluse from then on, which kinda defeats the purpose of everything, in my opinion).This film is well-filmed with steady and solid photography. It's most distinctive for utilizing both black-and-white and color photography together, to create a stark contrast between reality and fantasy. Acting is extremely goofy and over-the-top, but it all works for the film's benefit. It's always a hoot to watch Margaret Hamilton as the iconic villain, while Judy Garland and the rest of the cast provide much zeal and spirit to their roles. Writing is pretty silly, but it builds the story really well and features some very memorable lines. This production uses some rather limited sets, props, and costumes, many of which are outlandish and very fake-looking, but provide enough of an illusion to craft a vibrant spectacle with limited resources. Music is catchy and memorable.This movie is a must-see, if for no other reason than for its prestige and popularity throughout the decades. Highly recommended!4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)",4
  Wow I seen this movie before. And I like it because it has more action in it,0
"  A flawless masterpiece, A perfect tale and and incredible adaptation for every ages. Timeless.",5
"  of COURSE this is 5*... just because of the sentemental value of it. i couldnt get enough of the Oz movies as a young kid, i have to watch them again and i can cuz they're on sky atm :D",5
  really good fiml worth seeing bring the story of the world of oz together,5
  Watched it at least 8 times and I can't get enough. Movie is epic!,5
  One of the greatest movies ever!!,5
  Ironically more amusing than its highly modernized prequel (2013 movie). You just have to understand the lack of technology back then.,4
"  Epic, Magical, Cute, Charming and A Timless Classic",5
"  A spectacular pleasure. The Wizard of Oz is exactly what it intends to be: a pleasant, enjoyable,and playful romp through Oz with a colorful cast of characters.",4
"  99% Benefitting from fabulous visuals, beautiful storytelling and brilliant performances. The Wizard Of Oz is a classic that will be enjoyed by all ages!",4
"  Groundbreaking, classic, pleasurable and magical, this musical Fantasy still holds up today with spellbinding visual power and an untouchable sense of heart and joy. The costumes, effects and sets are like candy for the retinas and the actors are as appealing as possible and as for the songs, so many are memorable. Wizard of Oz not only defined the family fantasy film, it wrote much of the rulebook.",5
  Doesn't everyone want to follow the yellow brick road and get to Oz.,5
"  It's probably the quintessential fantasy film, and it's taken me until 2013 to see it? better late than never I suppose... Strong performances all round, the musical numbers are decent, and I think the film really comes alive when we actually meet The Wizard. I still maintain that Judy Garland was a very strange looking person (something about her face causes me to raise a Roger Moore-style eyebrow in puzzlement), but at least now when I watch Spaceballs the Yogurt sequence will make a bit more sense.",4
"  A classic in every sense of the word. Strange, magical, and every bit as interesting and funny today as it was when it first came out. For those who haven't seen it in years, dig it out and re-watch it, you will not regret it.",4
  Simply the BEST film ever made.,5
"  While I do not hold in such high regard as many critics and fans rightfully do, I cannot deny it special place in American cinema. Still to this day it is a treat to watch!",4
  A classic that has stood the test of time. 8/10,4
"  Yeah it is corny, but that is what makes The Wizard of Oz so great.",4
"  A timeless classic that still holds up even 70 years later, the wizard of oz is an amazing, beautiful, well crafted coming off age tale that has touched countless of people since it's release, and still continues to do so.",4
"  Move Matt here with The Wizard Of Oz. I'm doing this in honor of the recent release of Oz: The Great & Powerful (which opened Friday). No recaps here because the story is so well known. The film itself was really innovative with effects that couldn't be accomplished in 1939 without computers (like when Glinda first appears, she appears as a bubble & then dissolves). But by far the most innovative thing was the switch from Black & White to Color. The characters are perfect & The Lion, by far, remains my favorite with his lines & the way he acts all brave & then switches from brave to scared crapless at several points which makes for some good laughs. The songs are catchy & my favorite one is ""Ding Dong, The Witch Is Dead"" (which I'm currently listening to as I type this). When I see Oz next week, I'll slip in a review for that one as well. For this one, not for the skirmish but still a good film over all. It defines the term ""Classic"" & trust me, it is sjfh",5
"  A True Fantasy & Musical classic. No wonder it is a bright yellow brick road, because this film is pure gold entertainment (:",4
  Pretty entertaining actually.,4
"  One of those classic movies you grow up on and can watch a million times over. All the music in this one is amazing, especially Somewhere Over The Rainbow.I love that Kansas is made as a black and white, and bland place to live, whereas Oz is this colorful amazing place. What they did with effects for the time this was made, is simply amazing. The entire cast is amazing, but Garland is super adorable here and Hamilton's Wicked Witch is fantastic!!!The plot always makes me wonder if this was set either in her mind or maybe in Heaven, and then she came back to her body or woke up. It is a fantastic film about wishing for something more in life, but then in the end knowing what you have is the best thing you will ever need.",5
"  Thematically speaking, perhaps the most emulated film of all time - and still a joy to watch all these years later.",4
  The Wizard of Oz is a cute kids movie.,1
"  ""The Wizard of Oz"" will be a class in everyones eyes forever, bringing the light of day into the world of film and putting a smile on anyones face. As Dorothy dreams a dream that is unlike anything on earth, she creates a story that is one of the most brilliant telling in the history of film. I absolutely love this movie from start to finish. From it's clever dialogue, to it's hilarious acting, to the true heart of the story, this film surpasses any film of it's kind. Easily one of my favourites. New techniques and editing, the directors of this film (Victor Fleming and King Vidor) make it a wonder to behold! Absolutely stunning filmmaking!",6
  One of the best movies ever,5
  Best film growing up when I was a child,5
"  Coming from the great year in film of 1939 this is one of the quintessential musical, fantasy, and family films. It has some of the most famous songs around, a memorable cast including Judy Garland, and serves as a constant reminder that there's no place like home. Furthermore whenever we think villain the film's Wicked Witch is almost always ingrained in our minds. The story is adapted from the L. Frank Baum novel and it follows a young Kansas girl named Dorothy who lives on a farm with her aunt, uncle, the dog Toto, and three farm hands. When a big tornado hits, Dorothy becomes unconscious and when she wakes up she finds herself in Oz. There she encounters the good witch and the land of the Munchkins. As Dorothy begins her journey to the Great Oz to get home, she meets several unique characters. First there is a scarecrow who wants a brain, then a tin man who desires a heart, and finally a lion who aspires for courage. Together they travel to Oz and the wizard tells them they must kill the Wicked Witch of the West. Dorothy finds herself eventually in captivity but her new found friends rally to save her and inadvertently kill the Witch. When she gets back to Kansas Dorothy realizes that there is truly ""no place like home."" With iconic characters, memorable lines, and infectious songs it is easy to understand how this film became a classic. The added color does not hurt and also the special effects are not too shabby for 1939.",4
  dark side of the moon- pink floyd,5
  The quintessential childhood classic.,4
"  Full of whimsy, American iconography, and earnest weirdness. This movie kicks your dick off, bro. It really doesn't even need James Franco.",5
  Such a classic! who didnt love this movie as a kid!,4
"  If you don't like this movie, something is wrong with you.",5
  One of the greatest cinematic adventures to be put to screen! It's classic through and through!,6
  Though the visuals are groundbreaking for it's time and an average story. The unbalanced acting is what overall kills the movie.,1
"  For its clever storytelling and its pleasing visuals, this film is a classic that old and young must see.",5
  Perfection. This is film.,5
  CLASSIC MASTERPIECE!,5
  A wonderful classic. They don't make movies like this anymore. They take movies like this and remake them. They may be good but never as good as the original.,5
"  A classic, never gets old.",5
  Who doesn't like this movie? One of the best. But everyone has to see Return To Oz and Oz The Great And Powerful. That would make it a trilogy worth watching.,5
  Favorite movie ever!,5
  Childhood delight. It was thrilling knowing that I can still appreciate it as an adult,4
  i love this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
"  There's no place like home, and there's no film like this...",5
  A timeless classic that feels new and fresh every time I watch.,4
  I'm from Kansas and cant decide if that fact alone adds or subtracts a star...,2
"  The Wizard of Oz is one of those movies that is admired in the past, but in the future it gets criticized. But in the past, it was really good. The costumes were admired in 1939 because they were realistic at the time. The story was perfect, nothing wrong with it. The characters are fun and amazing. The acting was great. The Wizard of Oz is going to get a good score for me.",4
  Timeless. I don't know how many times have watched it but it still delights. Dorothy's three companions are all equally wonderful.,4
  My definite all time favorite movie.,5
  I'm a die hard Oz fan always baby lol,5
  One of the greatest films ever made!,5
  Perhaps the most overrated film ever.,2
  it was great back in 1939 but i don't see why people like this movie so much,1
  who doesn't like the wizard of oz??,5
  Incredible film for 1930's. This must have blown minds back in the day.,4
  My short-lived childhood was forever scarred by this movie. I also plea guilty to scarring other people with this movie. It may be a classic but I hate it for personal reasons.,2
  I do believe in spooks. I do believe in spooks. I do! I do! I do! I do believe in spooks. I do believe in spooks. I do! I do! I do! I do!,5
"  Classic, classic, classic. Especially when everything turns color!",4
  I would rather watch A Good Day To Die Hard then watch this crap,2
"  ""The Wizard of Oz"" is a beautiful film that deservedly earns the name ""masterpiece."" Perhaps the most accomplished part of this movie is the fact that it was made before CGI was invented, yet it still manages to dazzle.",5
  Needed more violence and shame.,2
  oh gooooodddd one act makes me hate this.,5
"  Happy and joyous as it is, every time Judy Garland slips into that most famous of songs, my heart breaks a little more ...",5
  This is a movie that goes way back for me! A special childhood classic,4
  the great and wonderful oz and he is,5
  Yeah it's corny but that's what makes it so good.,4
"  With impressive special effects for it's time, appealing story, and timeless humor is a movie no one would regret!",4
  An all time classic that will live on for ages.,5
"  Somewhere over the rainbow...Everything under the sun is in tune....There's no place like home...But the sun is eclipsed by the moon! I cannot help myself thinking of this as just an one-part side magical-musical spectacle, so sentimental and nostalgic that proves to be Old Hollywood's most Beautiful film ever, but there will never be like Oz again; Or, oh my dear companions ,it can also be seen as second-part side of the companion of a physiological-madness of horror color, as long as seen with Pink Floyd's Greatest Musical Achievement, thy great chaos was created by public obsession, It is already a great Musical feast, Over the Rainbow can be argued by me as the greatest intro song on a film, and such massive spectacle still is golden eccentric narrative at its purest form ... and dumb of me to say, it can also be the most twisted film of all time.",5
  Loved it!!! All time classic,5
"  É surpreendente que após quase um seculo desde seu lançamento, seus efeitos visuais continuam impressionado, as canções ainda emocionam e a lição de moral permanece viva e encantando crianças e adultos.",5
  My favourite movie ever!,5
"  The book is better. The movie is still a masterpiece, however. This is a movie everyone should see. What a wonderful, groundbreaking film.",5
  Quirky songs and classic jokes.,4
  Another classoc full of memorable songs and as much stuff for kids as for adults.,5
  I love this movie so much,5
"  Ah, IMO the crowning achievement of MGMThis film taught us all that there's a child still inside us when we grow upSure we try to act our age, but deep down we are still childrenI have to say this film is one of the best and I am proud to call it one of My Fondest Childhood Memories",5

  Watching this classic on Blu-ray is absolutely stunning.,5
  I love this movie its my favorite movie of all times,0
"  As yet another Oz movie is being contemplated, we need to remind ourselves how good the original film was and I think the aged production values allowed it to succeed to griping effect. This was truly another world so much different than the one we encounter today and not one that is easily replicated with today's modern film standards.",5
  Probably one of the most revolutionary films of all time. And I actually don't know what to say about it :),4
  one of the old movie good times!!! I watch it every time i see it on TV,5
  This is an instant classic! The overall direction and cinematography is amazing! There are very memorable characters and great casting especially Judy Garland as the main role as Dorothy. It is a great book adaptation by the same name. The film is magical and inventive.,5
"  In my humble opinion, the best movie ever made! They don't make em like this anymore!",5
"  I remember seeing this film when I was a child. It was aired on television about once a year between mid-winter and mid-spring. What stood out for me is just the sheer care that the movie took in presenting itself as a color film with such bright vivid colors that it almost transcends itself to an altered state kind of experience. This here is the film that ever child MUST see, it is not only a cinematic standard, but an American standard in film. It is essential to American culture as cheeseburgers, french fries, and apple pie. 5 stars hands down, a perfect film in every way.",5

  Still a classic after all these years,4

"  Grew up with a VHS copy taped from TV around Easter time...I can still tell you what commercials played during the movie ( Oshkosh, skittles, etc) I still have that copy and Will be getting the Bluray Soon. Will show this to my kids if I ever have any. A classic that will forever be in my heart ...LOVE this movie and watch it a coupe of times a year even now... Hope they dont destroy it in the 2013 version... Fingers crossed...",5
"  Since they decide to play it EVERY christmas, I now cant st",0
  not such a great kids movie kinda frighting for small children,1
  I used to watch this movie a lot as a child. I have lost count on how many times I have seen it.,4
"  Yeah, we all know this movie logically doesn't make any sense at all. But does it really matter? The answer is obviously no. The Wizard of Oz has some of the best music, best effects for the time it was made, and some of the best emotional moments ever made in history. Though countless remakes, semi-sequels, and prequels have been made, whenever version of Wizard of Oz most people remember is this one. IIt still holds up today as a cinematic classic.",5
  y does everyone make a big fuss about this movie?it's crap,2
  Dorothy Gale is swept away to a magical land in a tornado and embarks on a quest to see the Wizard who can help her return home.,5
  A classic in every sense of the word!,4
  An absolute masterpiece whose groundbreaking visuals and deft storytelling are still every bit as resonant The wizard of Oz is a must-see film for young and old,5
"  Timeless... I don't know anybody who doesn't have this film as even a small part of their childhood, and even if there is somebody in the world who doesn't, they will still find something to like in this film. 5/5",5
  I was in the play once... I was a munchkin. ...obviously I was very young.,2
  I used to watch this movie all the time! I think I like Wicked better... but you can never stray from the original!,4
  My granddaughter loves this movie I must have seen it 25 times already.,4
  Such an amazing adventure!!!! And the songs are so catchy & memorable!!,5
  It is looks very good concerning the fact that CG wasn't around then.,5
  My must fave movie of all time,5
  This is probably my favorite movie ever. Great music and performances.,5
"  How can you get any better than this? The music is timeless, and the story itself older than most of us. 73 years old, and this movie is still innocently funny.",5
"  fun film, its just a little weird watching it",4
"  Another movie my sister watched endlessly as a kid(probably more than any other movie). So I haven't watched it in years, but you can't deny the greatness of this movie. It's a classic and set the standard for its time.",5
  how does this Not get 100%?! Are you $@$@# crazy?!,5
  saw it a long time ago,5
  One of the best classics of all time!!,4
  classic for all time,5
  it is a well made movie,4
"  One of the Greatest Movies ever Made, this movie is a Timeless American Classic that is by far one of my all time favs!!",5
  luv it! did u no that in the tin mAn scene we they 1st meet him that u can see one of the munchkins hang himself?,4
"  Simply one of the most magical, funny, marvellous and timeless family films of all time.Full of archetypal characters, and scenes/sets/themes that will last forever.Amazing film.",5
  great casting and great movie. way better then the book.,0
"  When it was released, it was the Avatar of its time, but watching it now, it just seems like over-acted characters and a plot set up that is left almost entirely uncapitalized on. Maybe its just because I found Dorthy and the Cowardly Lion to be two of the most irritating characters I've ever seen.",1
  Best action movie ever,4
"  From start to the end this movie is pure, unstoppable adrenaline rush thats take no prizoners. basing whole movie on practical effects makes all the insane action more reall then in any other movie. This is 100% pure action movie that knows it and its here to deliver fun and excitment.",4
"  Bellissimo, oserei definirlo anche capolavoro nel suo genere! Miller ha diretto qualcosa di pazzesco ed è proprio la pazzia al centro del film, non a caso ""Mad Max: Fury Road"". Il tutto è perfetto, dalla fotografia alla scenografia, dai costumi e i trucchi ai veicoli, non da meno le ambientazioni e il montaggio. Tant'è che il film si è aggiudicato tanti Oscar e ha ricevuto anche altre candidature. Le scene d'azione sono girate in modo magistrale e non ci si perde nemmeno un momento di tutto quello che sta succedendo. Unico piccolissimo difetto è il fatto che alcune battute non si capivano bene per il fatto che fossero pronunciate in mezzo a tutto il caos, alla pazzia del film. Tom Hardy e Charlize Theron bravissimi ma è stato ancora più bravo Nicholas Hoult (Nux), un Figlio della Guerra che ha una bella evoluzione nel corso della pellicola. Proprio a proposito dei Figli della Guerra e di Immortan Joe, il loro capo, a me all'inizio hanno fatto abbastanza paura, mi hanno intimorito per la loro pazia e i costumi con cui si vestivano. Fantastico il fatto che durante gli inseguimenti ci fossero delle persone che suonavano i tamburi o la chitarra creando una atmosfera unica. Il film inizia da subito con l'azione e non si ferma praticamente mai, in 1h e 50m ci saranno stati soltanto 5 minuti di ""calma"". Un film PAZZO. AMMIRATEMI!",5
  I never expected to come out of Mad Max feeling so exhilarated. But DAMN! this one solid action movie. Fury Road relentlessly hammers the audience with raw brutal imagery and octane fueled action. Miller has done the unthinkable and has gone beyond expectations. Now where is our Furiousa follow up?,5
  holy shit THIS WAS THE WORST MOVIE i'VE SEEN IN AGES.,0
"  I liked this movie, but at the beginning of it, it didn't seem very well. So, my only problem with it, that it was boring at the beginning. But I really loved it and I'll watching again and again and again.Cause it really was good. The characters was amazing, story was good, CGI great.",4
  Apocalyptic pretension.,1
"  Didnt like it, too much make up and moving parts....no match for original movie, which budget was a tenth.",1
  Who could have expected this sequel to be soo good...one of the most visually and soundly epic movies.,4
"  SJW LIBTARD TRASH movie.Mad Max, who should be the GREAT WHITE MALE HERO of this movie, instead plays second fiddle to buzzcut-sporting feminist Furiosa. Furiosa is the real hero of this film and that is pure SJW LIBTARD garbage. During their fight, Max, the WHITE MALE HERO, nearly gets his head blown off twice by a one-armed Furiosa. WTF?? A man almost bested by a one-armed woman in physical combat?? That's pure, unadulterated SJW LIBTARD garbage.The main plot of this movie involves Furiosa and Max liberating Immortan Joe's wives from captivity. I guess Max is a liberal SJW libtard who doesn't believe that Immortan Joe should be able to grab their pussies or do whatever he wants to them. Well why not? Immortan Joe is the Trump-like God Emperor of this movie, after all. Mad Max is such a weak beta male cuck in this movie that at no point does he ever try to grab any of Immortan Joe's wives pussies or even Furiosa's pussy. Come on Max, those are some hot women!! Be a real man like Donald J. Trump and grab 'em!! Be a real God-fearing, conservative, religious, right-wing man and grab 'em by their pussies, Max!! What are you, one of those MGTOW homosexuals? Come to think of it, the actor playing Max is kind of short and he isn't even American for Chrissakes, so maybe Max IS one of those MGTOW homosexuals!Like I said, SJW LIBTARD TRASH movie.",0
  This is one of the best looking films I have ever seen. Plot is not complex. Max is not the start of this film. I just gave all the things people could complain about. Any other complaint should be ignored.,5
"  For me, this movie was in the category ""I haven't watched this yet, but people are saying it's really masterpiece"" I know that I needed to find time to watch it earlier... I did it yesterday using boxxy software and I regret that I didn't watch it before...When you know that everything you watch is for free and your software is for free it's the real pleasure!",5
"  I love the world Dir George Miller created, it was visually stunning for a deserted apocalyptic world that was very much dead and barren, making it hauntingly beautiful. Besides the visual aspects, the characters and dynamics of the world were intriguing and although they were other-worldy it was very much reflective of our own making this movie so much more than a typical apocalypse action film/",4
"  This Movie is Epic! everything : music, direction, acting , cinematography. Just Amazing! Charlize is BadAss, the heroine we need!",5
"  My expectations were exceptionally high going in as The Road Warrior is one of my all-time favorite movies. This movie, despite those high expectations, managed to exceed them all and still deliver. I watched it in the theater twice, both in 2D and 3D. Then I bought the DVD. I love this movie. Fantastic.",4
"  Genius choreography and cinematography fit like a puzzle piece with this films story and environment that is truly dripping with substance and style. Oh, and it's also damn awesome to watch spiky cars be torn apart by explosions, suicide bombers and George Miller's intense dedication to glorious practical effects. I like this movie a lot.",5
"  Mad Max: Fury Road is nothing short of the best action film of all time. Absolute perfection is achieved in every department - the writing, characters, design, cinematography, and absolutely everything else are all top-notch. The only fault that comes to mind with George Miller's masterpiece here is that I don't think any other action film will ever be able to top this.",5
"  10/10 With an absorbing story, great performances, and the high-octane action the franchise is known for, Mad Max: Fury Road successfully brings the series back to life.",5
"  THIS. This is an action movie. I hate action movies because the stories are often vapid. The story in Mad Max: Fury Road is meaningful, It's powerful. And it's matched only by the stunning cinematography. This movie is gorgeously shot and perfectly edited. Every action scene is natural. It isn't forced, even if there are some very choreographed scenes. It works. And considering the movement of the vehicles as these shots take place, it feels real. I'm sure there are some effects used, but the scale is epic and reminds me of the intensity of the chariot races in ""Ben-Hur."" Simply said, this movie is brilliant.",5
"  It's official; Mel Gibson is no longer Mad Max.The surprise hit of the summer was a visual spectacle that raised the bar for the summer blockbuster. George Miller, at age 70, beautifully showcased the true vision he had for the dystopian future he first put on screen 35 years ago.On the backdrop of a harsh landscape and reality, the lead character with out using much dialogue (except for grunts and groans) tries to overcome a tormented past and survive. When put like that, Mad Max: Fury Road is essentially The Revenant with much better car chases. Furiosa, played by Charlize Theron, is the real focus of the film. She was the one who carried the movie, giving us a heroine on par with the likes of Ellen Ripley from the Alien series or Sarah Conner from Terminator. The plot isn't over complicated, and the story's foundation is strong, which allows for the creative direction of the movie For example, how the movie's score blends with and often is provided by the characters on screen. Finally, the practical effects and stunt work were stunning, maybe one day they will turn Mad Max: Fury Road into a Cirque De Soleil show. I'll be first in line.",4
  My favourite movie of all time. A cinematic masterpiece,5
"  This movie is amazing! If I had to pick something I didn't like my only complaint is that I didn't want it to end! The action, the cars, the acting, the characters, the plot... excellent all the way around. I've watched it around 20 times and it still blows me away.",5
  Tremendous Action Film...Great Movie,5
  Best chase movie ever made it's up there,4
  WHat was the story about ??,0
  Great new twist on Mad Max. Loved it.,5
  Amazinginly fun movie with nonstop action. Must watch.,5
"  The second best of the Mad Max movies, behind Max Max Beyond Thunderdome (I know I'm in the minority with my rankings, but Thunderdome rocks the house!). Not only is it a great apocalypse movie, but a great car chase movie. The character development was great, and Tom Hardy does a great job replacing Mel Gibson as Mad Max. I'm at a busy stage in life where having time to watch a movie is a rare guilty pleasure, and I'll gladly take that fleeting moment to sneak a peak of Fury Road.",5
"  Easily the best action movie in some time. Stupendous action with plenty of actual stunts and stuff blowing up (really big explosions!), cleanly shot and edited for coherence. More surprisingly and in a good way, much of the film has the titular character coming across more like a supporting character in a story driven by women asserting themselves against cruel, hideous (in all senses) men and which takes them and their struggles seriously.",4
  Best action movie ever!!????,5
"  One of the best displays of filming ever to take place. The most unbelievable thing about this movie, is that nobody was seriously injured or died while on set. Everything is real, and not enhanced through the use of computers. Acting is top notch (Charlize Theron). Tom Hardy does not speak too much throughout the movie, but his quietness is able to speak volumes for how fantastic of a movie this is.",5
"  Appalling film - CGi and nothing else, dreadfulsound, CGI and basically everything apart form C Therons acting ability through this CRAP! Shold not have wasted the money, PLEASE PLEASE STOP MAKING THIS RUBBISH.",0
  I forced myself to sit through this awful movie. It redeemed itself with some good visuals at times.,1
  Rarely are remakes better than the first but Fury Road captured all the good of the original Mad Max lore without the slow nature of the first. One of my favorite movies of all time.,5
"  what a very silly film. Great fun to watch though. I can never get over the invincibility of the main protaginists (despite some death along the way), and the ending was a bit twee. However, the action was superb, and the guitar wagon was a great touch.",4
"  Mad Max: Fury Road-The name of the film is Fury Road. It was directed by George Miller and themain characters are Mad Max who is played by Tom Hardy, Furiosa who isplayed by Charlize Theron and Nux who is played by Nicholas Hoult.-Years after the collapse of civilization, the tyrannical Immortan Joe enslavesapocalypse survivors inside the desert fortress called the Citadel. When thewarrior Imperator Furiosa leads the despot's five wives in a daring escape, sheforges an alliance with Max, a loner and former captive. Fortified in themassive, armored truck the War Rig, they try to outrun the ruthless warlord andhis henchmen in a deadly high-speed chase through the Wasteland.-The plot seems to be absorbing.-The special effects are outstanding and stunning.-The photography is really incredible and impressive.-The acting performance is spectacular, believable and powerful.-The writting script is thought-provoking, compelling and moving.-I find this film absolutely fascinating and compelling. If you haven't seen ityet, you don't know what you have been missing. Fury Road is one of myfavourite films in the world.",5
  An action masterpiece. 100% pure adrenal awesomeness.,5
"  Es una obra maestra, el desarrollo de personajes es tan bueno que podría haber una secuela de cada uno de ellos. En especial de Furiosa que rápidamente se ha convertido en las mejores heroínas de los 2000.",5
"  Probably the best action you can see in a film, and almost certainly the best action film in recent years. Despite a limited role for Tom Hardy as Max, he serves as the thread of the film though he is overshadowed by Charlize Theron as Furiosa who is de facto the main character and protagonist of this film. All round great film, shame it didn't do better at the box office.",4
  THE BEST MOVIE IN THE MOVIE HISTORY OF ALL TIME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
  THE BEST ACTION MOVIE IN DECADES!!!! A must watch for all cine fans.,5
  Over-hyped. Weak story. Weak characters. All CGI no soul.,0
"  Given the outstanding reviews I expected a much better movie than this. The entire movie is basically a ""car"" chase with no plot and no context. Sure, it's very spectacular and well-filmed but only that doesn't make a good movie. Disappointed.",2
"  Mad Max, Fury Road brings everything that we liked with the Mad Max franchise and puts it in a long, epic action movie.",4
"  Very simple story, but a case study in great filmaking in continuity and grand action.",4
"  Having never seen and of the other Mad Max films, I went into this blind on a random night with a buddy of mine. Within the first few minutes of them film I was absolutely blown away. Beautiful cinematography awed me and captivating characters made me wanting more. I only hope more comes of this new entry in the franchise.",5
  Absolutely gripping from start to finish - also stunning cinematography.,5
  Mad Max Fury Road (In den alten Teilen war Mel Gibson der Hauptdarsteller. In diesem ist es Tom Hardy der nicht überzeugt. Ein Science-Fiction Film mit ein paar Bildern die hängenbleiben),2
"  Mad Max: Fury Road - 4 out of 5- Great all out action film. Not much plot to this film it starts with action and never really stops if your looking for a Oscar type film this is not for you if you are looking for a visually beautiful, fast paced crazy out there action with big explosions This is for you I absolutely loved this film everyone should go see it on the big screen and buy it when it comes out.",4
"  Tom Hardy is great as Max and the car chases are awesome. If you wanna watch some Mad Max films then watch ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"" (1981) and this one.",4
  A fun thrilling and Exiting film with great Action packed chases both Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy are great and This film was just a fun ride.,4
  Gripping from start to finish. Great visuals. An excellent addition to the series.,4
"  This is hands down one of my favorite movies of all time. If you have not seen it, then I highly recommend it! The actors were great, The costumes and cars used in this film were awesome. I am not really a fan of action films, but this one was awesome!",4
"  the fourth 'mad max' epic defies the usual run of jaunty, often cack-handed modern blockbusters. this uncompromising, raucous action outing approaches the bitter truth of survival without knavish quiver. it relies on visceral sensations (like the breathtaking barren landscape), amble stride and chase scenes shot with inimitable legerity. charlize theron is a simply fascinating personage and at her plaintive best. all these license the film reward for giving little thought to genre convention and its own barbaric uniqueness. prestige has been put back into action cinema.",0
  A masterpiece. George Millar raises the bar for his franchise and all action films. a two hour car chase that provides a remarkably feminist perspective. So much so that you might find yourself doing a reverses the Bechdel test.,0
"  Back in 2015, most people were excited about Star Wars: The Force Awakens. While the idea of a new mainline entry in the Star Wars series was a bit exciting to me, it could not compare to the excitement I had to see a new entry in the Mad Max series - the first since 1985's underrated Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome (Nor could Star Wars compare to my excitement for Jurassic World). It had been 30 years, Max Rockatansky was played by a new actor, and we were off on a new trajectory despite the fine story arc laid out by the original trilogy. There were apprehensions and there were expectations, and by God, somehow this film managed to live up to those expectations. It not only stays true to the original trilogy, but it also modernizes itself for a new age, is strikingly progressive, and it is also the best action film I've seen this decade. As much fun as the Force Awakens was, Mad Max: Fury Road is how you bring a franchise back to life with roaring, glorious intensity. The action is superb, relying mostly on practical effects over CGI. The acting is superb, particularly with Tom Hardy taking on the legendary Max Rockatansky role and Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa. Not only does the film have thrilling action sequences, but the story is also surprisingly well written and intelligent, as well as having genuine moments of emotion as you become invested in their lives despite knowing little about their origins. It's a beautiful, breath-taking, thrill-a-minute, emotionally-charged, and overflowing with energy. If you're a true fan of action films, you owe yourself to watch Mad Max: Fury Road. It's not only the best action film of the decade, but one of the best films, period. This is how you reboot a franchise. It's a glorious masterpiece.",5
  Brilliant. Basically.,5
  Easily one of the best action movies ever made.,5
"  The movie has no meaning at all. The plot is terrible and the guitar playing guy is idiotic. Sure it has cool ""fight scenes"" but overall the movie is not good. Not worth the oscars.",1
"  This is one of my favorite movies. Gorgeously shot, wonderfully acted, well paced, with everything you want from a post-apocalyptic desert destruction derby.",5
"  This film is insanely good. I was a little skeptical when I heard they were making another Mad Max movie, and then they replaced Gibson...but this is a rip roaring thrill ride of carnage and destruction that harks back to the best moments of the franchise and gives you realistic, white knuckle action in spades.An absolute blockbuster! Proving again that the overuse and reliance on CGI has ruined the action genre.",4
"  A dirty, bloody masterpiece. Mad Max: Fury Road is a breathe of fresh air into the seemingly lackluster time for action movies. Bringing back practical effects and real explosions instead of using fake, unrealistic CGI (which the movie uses very little of). Tom Hardy was solid as Mad Max in the film, showing potential to be great in his next two installments of Mad Max films he signed for. In the end, I don't see any action movie topping Fury Road for a long time(except for maybe Mad Max: The Wasteland).",5
  Wholly engaging and visually epic. Didn't want the ride to end.,5
"  Although it does not have too much of an original plot, Fury Road successfully revives the Mad Max franchise in this thrilling, action packed adventure that not only looks great but is also very well constructed. The characters are all rather well fleshed out, and even though Mel Gibson is not in this movie Tom Hardy does rather well as Max. Overall this thrilling fourth instalment is a great success in filmmaking.",4
"  Delivers at every level, an intelligent ROLLER COASTER of a movie. The two leads are excellent and George Miler's vision of an aPOcaLypTIC world is stunning. Great sets and action SEQUENCES, a solid supporting cast, as good as it gets!",4
"  I'm going to be honest: this is the only Mad Max movie I've seen, and I know almost nothing about the other ones. The fact that I still love this movie is a good indication that it can stand on it's own. The story and characters are simple, but effective, and I can still get a good idea of what's going on despite not much being explained. The movie is also basically a 2-hour car chase with some of the best action in any movie ever. That alone is enough to make me love it.",4
  epic. visually stunning. charlize and tom hardy are excellent. great worldbuilding.,5
"  Good, yes. great, no.",5
  An adrenaline rush in a high order of film making,4
  Best action movie of the 2000's. By far. Loved pretty much everthing about iT.,5
"  I love this movie! The storyline is amazing, but it depends on the type of genres you like, so if you like post-apocalyptic genres, survival, and action, this movie is for you!",4
  One of fave action movies! I have seen this repeatedly and will continue to do so! The action is relentless and the characters compelling. Love love love it!,5
  Bad movie. It won't let me do 0 stars but that's what this movie earned,0
"  What this movie lacks in plot it makes up in visual brilliance. It doesn't waste time with lengthy or clunky exposition. This movie goes right into the action and proves that lives sets will always be better than an overdose of CGI. It's hard to tell if this is a sequel or a reboot but by the end of the movie I assure you, you won't care either way. Watching this movie in HD/4k Ultra is like putting on a nice pair of glasses for the first time and the soundtrack is just as epic. This is a movie where you eat popcorn and let the movie overload your senses.",5
"  It humanizes what character development it has, and keeps it simple from the storytelling perspective. But the centerpiece here are the action sequences, beautifully done, and breaking a few action cliches we see in movies today. My tiny problem with the film was the way George Miller transitioned his scenes; they slowed down a film a bit, but does not damage the film as a whole.",5
  This is a thundering return to the Mad Max series. Almost no action movie can top or rival it.,5
"  Now a lot of you snowflakes may call me a sexist. But check me out, I gave glowing reviews on the feminist movie!! Proves that I am honest about my reviews. Not like you snowflake crybabies. Now back to the movie. Plenty of action and really like the dope mad motors.",4
"  It's in my Top 5 Best Action Movies Ever for sure. A rare case of an genre that's usually ignored in the Awards Season, but the amazing storyline, performances (by Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron) and the suberb score, visual effects, make up and sound mixing made this an masterpiece in this industry!|It's a 9 out of 10|",5
  The best action movie in this century.,4
  If i could give this movie 10 stars i would.,5
"  Muito bom o filme, só não gosto mais que o primeiro da franquia.",4
"  Title: Mad Max Fury RoadStory/Writing/Message/Plot: 3Character/Acting: 4Music/Sound: 5Cinematography/Editing: 5Age/Originality: 4Total: 21/25Simple story, simple character with bold and amazing spectacle. Film is all about telling a story in visual way and Mad Max: Fury Road is absolutely the best film that describe this. This film proves us that a story that is as simple as driving out into the dessert and coming back can be a hurricane jet coaster ride. The tempo is fantastic and though most of the film is action, we do not get bored at the slightest. The visual are beautiful. There is minimal use of CG but used wisely and properly for maximum result. We can feel the tension every time because they are real. The music multiplies the world and every character are capable to be the main character. No one is spoiled in this film. There isn't much I can say but if I would have to say one negative thing is that I am worried if there is any sequel to be made, it may not bring anything further then this Fury Road.",4
"  One of the best movies I have ever seen. Story line is just so unpredictable, weird and like nothing like I've seen before.",5
"  I can recall being a huge skeptic about a modernized Mad Max film. I'm very glad my skepticism was proven wrong, as this turned out to be an unexpected masterpiece. The film has plenty of strange tidbits and ideas that all worked wonderfully together; from the unusually delivered dialogue, to the outlandish characters, to the dystopian culture imagined by George Miller himself. It's an action thriller where the true treat of the film is not the action itself, but rather it's everything else surrounding it. Tom Hardy helms the title role, but its Charlize Theron who owns the film with the strongest performance out of everyone, portraying a character of ferocity and guts who also has vulnerable side to her. Also recognition to an excellent supporting cast including Keough, Kravitz, H-Whiteley, and Eaton as the ""wives,"" and Hoult as ""Nux the war boy.""",5
"  Containing many, many car chases with lots and lots of thrills and spills along the way, it took me a while to settle in to this action blockbuster. Helped along by some touching human elements and occasional comical ones, 'Mad' Max is strangely the most 'normal' character in the film. AAN GGN AACTA AFI1001",2
  MADMAX is a masterpiece with Tom hardy in the role this movie is a great movie of 2015 it could be the best 2015 movie to me. With great action cars blowing up and awesome fight's this movie is a must see one the best movies ever made in my life time 10/10,5
"  If you thought the original Mad Max movies were crazy, this is like those movies drank a six pack of Red Bull and snorted coke. Fury Road is an insane, high-octane, action-packed sequel and even with it's nearly non-stop action it has a pretty interesting narrative. If you are an action junkie, Fury Road is sure to satisfy you and possibly more.",4
  Beautifully shot and amazing action sequences. Directed brilliantly with amazing acting. Makes up what it lacks in a plot and is really spectacular,4
  Loved every minute of it. Hadn't expected to but I did. ^_^ Nostalgia Critic's review inspired me to watch it.,5
  You could walk out for half an hour during the film and you wouldn't miss anything. A very overrated film.,1
"  This is an enjoyable blockbuster with moments of sheer brilliance, Miller breathes life into the genre with incredible set pieces and some excellent visual humour and observations. The plot though, is there even one there? Not really. Whatever people say about this film, it's basically 'Mad Max 2' updated, you can never recreate the incredible unease, tone and zeitgeist of that first film. In my opinion it will never be matched.",2
"  A terrible, nonsensical story with the title character mostly along for the ride.",1
"  Fury Road had one of the best trailers in the cinematic history, and to my surprise it exceeds that ridiculously high expectation. Total exhilaration and pure visual awe for two hours, with relatively little stands in the way of the continuous castle siege on wheels.Story is simple enough, although I wouldn't mind the film adds another 20 mins for extra character and the dystopia developments.Nonetheless, what a crazy good time at the cinema. It left me trying to catch my breath and every recent action flicks in the dust. Frankly, I feel bad for any film lovers that somehow managed to miss it.",5
  stunning!!! i could watch this movie 100 times.,4
"  Mindless action flick with no purpose. Take the car out, turn around and go back. A masterpiece of mediocrity in screenwriting.",1
"  I´ve never been a fan of action movies...but this movie has intelligent, intense and emotionally rich plot, awesome world building and the most beautiful scenes. My favorite movie!",5
  Worst movie I have seen in the last decade.,0
  Got the expected and unexpected. Difficult to relate to characters except Charlize. The road rage scenes were brilliant as one would expect,2
  I could not believe that a fourth installment in a movie franchise could be this good!This movie takes the original idea developed in the part 2 and expands it into an even more frightful idea of dystopia that would probably depress you if it worn't for the main cast that blows you away with fantastic performance. It is often difficult to explain what does it mean when a movie has depth and Fury Road can serve as a reference point for it. All the praises for what George Miller achieved.,5
"  George Miller does it again, delivering another chapter in an amazing saga. Definitely recommend.",4
  I just love this movie. The action set pieces blew me away even before I found it that it was made with mostly practical effects. Tom Hardy can do no wrong and Charlize Theron is an outstanding lead female essentially making the film her own.,5
"  Mad max: fury Road, mad max furia en el camino En un futuro post-apocaliptico donde lo único que importa son los vehículos motorizados y la gasolina existe un loco llamada max, un expolicía que es acosado por los vivos y por los muertos entrelaza cu camino con furiosa una chica que planea una rebelión contra inmortal un dictador que tienen a todo su pueblo en la miseria muertos de hambre y sed.Hablando de lo bueno y de las primeras buenas noticias que supimos desde antes del estreno de la película es que Hiba a ser dirigida por el mismo George Miller, justamente el director de la trilogía original de mad max el cual debo mencionar que mientras más viejo está Miller mejor dirige películas el es la prueba viviente de que la vejes no te vuelve inútil, otro punto muy bueno de la película son los mismos personajes, todos son muy llamativos e interesantes, sobre todo el personaje de furiosa, es increíble y fue un gran acierto el no sexualisarla como lo hacen el 90% de los directores actuales a la hora de hacer un personaje femenino.El soundtrack es bestial y va muy bien con las escenas y la temática de la película, los efectos especiales son grandiosos de echo no existe el CGI en la película, todo es maquillaje y utilería que le da un toque muy clásico que nos recuerdan a las películas de acción de los 70s, y si está película como toda película de acción tiene explociones cada 5 segundos pero Miller los supo usar de una forma increíble mostrando la vulnerabilidad ante el daño de los personajes, mostrándonos que son humanos, sin duda la saga rápidos y furiosos tiene mucho que aprender de este filme.Puntos malos: realmente no pude encontrar puntos malos tan así para mencionarles.En conclusión: está película es increíble y grandiosa, la recomiendo a todo el mundo tanto publico cinéfilo como crítico y casual.",5
  Such amazing film! lt is perfect in every way!,5
"  was kind of forced into watching this one. but i really really enjoyed it. it felt iconic. politics or no politics you choose. i choose to watch it without the meaningless feminist subtitles. because it has incredible action, stunts, a good story and great acting. it might not be pretty but every detail of the film is worth looking at and admiring for its intricacy. not sure what the title character 'mad max' had to do with anything. but he was tom hardy so naturally brilliant to watch even if it was a question why he was relevant at all to the plot.",5
"  ""Fury Road"" is one of the greatest action films ever made, it features amazing practical effects and numerous dazzling shots and scenes. The set and character designs are memorable, and the film follows the rule of showing instead of telling.Even though the plot is simple and straight-forward, there is more depth to these characters than one might think. You will find yourself emotionally invested in them.Most importantly though, this has all the insanity and more that you would expect from a Mad Max movie. It's one of the most spectacular films ever made.",5
  I want to kill everything!! Ahh!! Jk it good,5
  This movie stands alone on its bad-ass action sequences and deep message.,5
"  (87/100)It's a good movie, don't get me wrong, but I don't really understand the 97% rating by the critics...",4
  Top action movie of last 20 years!,5
  M-F-O9.2[George Miller][c],5
"  Un capolavoro senza tempo, Mad Max: Fury Road è un film incredibile, sensazionale e travolgente. George Miller torna dopo tutti questi anni e ci propone un'opera esagerata, che sbaraglia completamente qualsiasi forma di concorrenza, sia del 2015 che, oserei dire, di tutto il decennio. Non serve essere fan della trilogia originale, e quasi non serve averla vista. Chiunque si accorgerebbe della perfetta esecuzione delle scene d'azione sotto tutti gli aspetti tecnici. Non servirebbe neanche elencare tutti i pregi della pellicola, ma mi vorrei soffermare sul montaggio. E' senza dubbio il miglior montaggio che io abbia mai visto: conferisce un ritmo serrato e frenetico al tutto, unendo le scene con una precisione maniacale. Sapere che il lunghissimo lavoro è stato fatto da una singola donna, la moglie del regista tra l'altro, rende la cosa ancora più eroica. Oltre a questo è da sottolineare il perfetto lavoro che si è svolto sul comparto sonoro, sia per quanto riguarda la colonna sonora, che per il montaggio sonoro dei rumori. Quest'ultimo aspetto rende il film un'opera unica, che va gustata anche con le orecchie e non solo con gli occhi. La storia è funzionale all'azione e all'intrattenimento, offre qualche situazione apprezzabile, anche se chi non conosce tutto l'universo di Mad Max potrebbe riscontrare qualche difficoltà a collegare alcuni pezzi del puzzle. Nel complesso si tratta di un'opera magistrale, che dimostra a gran voce le infinite possibilità che si possono sfruttare con il cinema. E' uno dei miei film preferiti in assoluto, e senza dubbio tra i migliori film d'azione della storia.",5
  All you need to know is a character plays a flame throwing guitar ...,4
  Popcorn action at its best. This film blew me away and the action sequences are a spectacle to behold,5
"  I know seems weird, I just dont liek this movie at all",1
  Great Movie. Me and my husband loved it. Mad Max and Furoisa were awesome.,5
"  Puntaje Original: 8.5Una película espectacular, acción de inicio a fin, conectando perfectamente la acción con el desarrollo de la historia, probablemente de las mejores del género de acción.",4
  Greatest action movie I've ever seen.,5
  A cinematic marvel that deserves a spot in every action movie lover's library,5
"  It's nice to have a story about women and some of the shots are beautiful, but at the end of the day it really is just a movie about a long car chase. It was very tiring.",2
"  This film is little more than bells, whistles and feminist tripe ... barely acceptable casting, zero character development, a non-script and a complete sense of 'Why?!?' Garbage ... first to last minutes.",1
"  That flame guitar. Great dystopia. All characters are amazing: I would like to see more of this movie, like a prequel or something, this movie is amazing, but everything happens too fast.",4
"  Time has only improved this action masterpiece, solidifying its perfection.",5
  Did you see the trailer? If so you saw all the parts worth watching.,0
"  Well after MAD MAX:BEYOND THE THUNDERDOME, i was quite sceptical as to how this cult-classic saga might get back on the right track. MAD MAX and MAD MAX: ROAD WARRIOR were such superior that BEYOND THUNDERDOME was a little bit of regression compared to them. Also a question was lingering: would a new mad max movie have the same mind-blowing effect 2015 as it had in 1980?. To this question my answer was rather 50-50 but george miller proved not only me but, i suppose, many WRONG!!!!This guy is simply what you call a great director. MAD MAX:FURY ROAD takes its stand from ROAD WARRIOR but with the essence of the first movie. Tom Hardy does a great job as MAX ROCKATANSKY but its Charlize Theron's FURIOSA who stole the show; indirectly, this movie is a female-lead action packed explosive fun ride.Dazzling visuals, mind-blowing actions and a great performance by the lead as well as the secondary cast and the vision of a legend like george miller simply makes MAD MAX:FURY ROAD one of the best movies of 2015 and certainly a cult-classic action movie which will be remembered for years just as its predecessors.",5
  One word; outstanding!,5
  Absolutely epic movie.,5
"  Insane action. Just phenomenal. And along with that, awesome performances. This movie is a non-stop thrill ride. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Future classic. One of my favourite action films.",5
"  Big, laud and epic. Storyline is very simple, yet movie is totally satisfying.",5
"  This movie just drives me crazy. You look for the word ""action"" in the dictionary and you will find this masterpiece.",5
"  I love this movie for the same reasons as Conan the Barbarian (1980). The action is super clear filmed so that we really see what happens there the story is told very linear so that everyone can understand. (Many say the story is so simple but I can not think outside the box because so little is said in this movie). The action is super filmed, almost praised, actors give everything they can only by facial expressions and gesticulating because very little is talked about in this movie the music is cool. Yes, I'm honest, there are only two songs that I think are super blatantly the rest was okay.",4
"  So good when you're high and when you're not high. An Academy Award winning film full of action, badass cars, and an overall incredible film despite the simplicity of the storyline. Great costumes, sets, and props as well as award winning cinematography.",4
"  Mad Max: Fury Road is the definition of pure knock your socks off entertainment. With it's extraordinary achievement in cinematic mastery, Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the best films of the last 10 years.",5
  WITNESS ME!!!! enough said,5
"  Yes, yes, yes now this one is a MAD MAX film I so love. MAD MAX fury road was one of the most outstanding and incredible post-apocalyptic film in the trilogy and also the strongest one in the trilogy with very good set pieces and it was very artistic plus Tom hardy did a good job playing Max and Charlie Theron did also a good job playing as furiosa. Overall it was the best one in the series and it was fun watching these amazing films well done George Miller you made one hell of a action-packed film and an amazing trilogy.well done I LOVE THIS FUCKING FILM AND ALL OF THE FILMS TOGETHER. Well done.",5
"  In a world where dystopian futures tend to be over-explained in order to captivate audiences, Mad Max simply show as a simple story immerse in a complex universe, with a fuzzy line of good and wrong balancing the survival of the human race.",4
"  This film has so many good qualities, it's hard to know where to start. Charlize Theron's furious warrior-woman; the near-mythic avatar of justice, Max Rockastansky; the breeding harem; the insane aging warlord; the custom designed vehicles; the utter desperate bizarreness in a post-apocalyptic culture; etc.; all these things make this a very tight feature. But I could wax poetic on every scene about the timing and editing. This movie is put together so well I could set my heartbeat by it.",5
  This is one of my favourite movies of all time,5
"  Possibly the best film ever made... A high octane adrenalin fuelled pig shit crazy pandemonious extravaganza of non stop action and wonder. This is a special film that will be watched by audiences for decades and decades to come. Also I saw this both in 2D and in 4D and it was awesome both times, in fact this is the best film I have seen in 4D ever.",5
  Excruciating idiotic nonsense. Never in the field of human film making has so much technology and so much money been used by so many to make so much shit for so many morons. Harsh? No f**&ing; way.,1
  Sense of substitution,4
  5/5. Everything I wanted out of Mad Max film and so much more. The best film in a fantastic series.,5
  It's an amazing film.,5
  If you like car chases in the desert and explosions then you'll like this movie. While I liked Charlize Theron's performance I found this movie to be long and dull. The majority of the movie is taken up by 2 long car chases. Mad Max played by Tom Hardy doesn't have much dialog. Max spends most of the movie chained up and used for blood transfusions. Stick with the original with Mel Gibson.,2
"  A rare film that knows exactly what it is, doesn't needlessly reach for something deeper and has a surprising amount of character. The most focused and entertaining action movie I've seen in a long time.",5
"  This film has no ascertainable plot and is merely an acrobatic car chase. The film does not follow the rules of the Mad Mad Universe in which it exists; the primary rule being scarce resources must treated as scarce resources. They waste water, they destroy all their vehicles, the use inordinate amounts of fuel... even driving a stage featuring an electric guitar with a massive flame throwing tower amplification system to every battle..., they loose track of their only non-mutant women, they waste bullets, and despite existing in a post apocalyptic world all their vehicles are some how souped up and pimped out. The actions of the characters just don't make sense when considering the ground rules which the series has created. A science fiction movie can make up any rules it wants, but then it must follow those rules. The film has good acting and cinematography, but does it really matter?",2
"  A movie so visually striking from the first frame to the last that you'll think you've gotten lock-jaw by the end from watching the whole thing open-mouthed. An absolute visual feast and a triumph of cinematograghy, directing, acting and editing. The story, though fairly straightforward is interesting enough to keep you engaged and is relentlessy action packed. A couple of somewhat macabre moments come off as somehow amusing but clearly intentionally so. The 3D version also looks great with the depth adding another level to the overall experience. A real must see.",5
"  This is a movie I had not seen until two years after its release. I liked the film, but some things just didn't make that much sense. There is a lot going on at once, and some of the stuff is just so random, but they do a good job with it. I really loved the character of Furiosa in the movie. The way they threw in some flashbacks at some points to help explain Max's backstory was more efficient in my opinion, as opposed to if they just did a full 10+ minute backstory on him. And again, with everything going on at once, it probably would've been hard to do anyway. The motivations of all the characters very clear and well thought out and the action was some of the best I've ever seen in a movie before.",4
"  Mad Max Fury Road: Beautifully shot, top notch special effects, intensly crafted action scenes, and surprisngly amount of narritve, brings George Millers post-apocalyptic franchise roaring vigorously back to life.",5
"  If you are into cars, action and madness, this is the perfect movie for you. It's a wild ride that you will most certainly have fun with; Enjoy and go mad! &^D",5
  20/10/2017 - Crazy action masterpiece. Easily one of the greatest action films ever made. Right up there with Terminator 2!,5
"  AMAZING. so different, weird and creative. action is impeccable, not only great but had a very real feel to it probably because practical effects and real stunts were used much more than CGI. surprisingly deep for this kind of movie. phenomenal original score, might be my favorite. so many intense, suspenseful and epic scenes. I was on the edge of my seat throughout. I said ""that's the coolest thing I've ever seen"" about 47 times during the movie. WITNESS ME! the sandstorm scene is probably my favorite action sequence ever. so much about this movie is elite: the directing, the action, the score, the cinematography, the acting by the three leads (Hardy, Theron, Hoult), the imaginative world that was created, the creativity of the characters. on my 8th viewing i was so blown away that i decided to give it my imaginary 5.5 rating. only other movie i've given that to is interstellar. as of now, mad max fury road is my second favorite movie of all time. it makes me happy :) (8 viewings)",5
"  (5.0 out of 6)When the vary thing we see that gets us moving is the last thing that puts us in a place to start living when the vary thing that gets us living we can let them be the last thing that ends all and any place for all mankind.When we dont see what the world would turn out until you live in it to know it is what it is and we have to survive it. Long past what we see and know to blame, or put a stop to it. When what we see is a mad world where all that is left our natural resources controlled by warlords. When what we see we can't escape from when it's all around us and only place we can go or return to is where life can live with the natural resources.

When we don't know why all what is gone is gone to only see what we can grasp. When we see we must travel far, count on unlikely people to steer us there, find refuge in what so little remains, course through the warring environments, family quarrels, business and political disputes to live freely how we intended civilly.

  Pounding action and stunning choreography give Mad Max: Fury Road a million thrills...and yet the plot satisfies as well.,4
"  While a strong sense of discontinuity is there from the beginning, the plot for MM:FR makes itself clear over the course of the film. Unfortunately, there is no real beginning for the characters, the place, the time. It just IS, and we are made to accept it. The end of civilization must be taken at face value in this iteration of the Mad Max franchise, with no real connection to the first Mad Max or even Road Warrior. This film is a close cousin to ""Beyond Thunderdome"" in its autocratic ruler of the McGuffin. In ""Thunderdome"", it was Bartertown. In Fury Road, it is the clean water. The road sequences are thrilling and ear-shattering. The action is incredible, and the fight scenes are tough, if not impossible, to beat.I just wish there had been more connection to the previous Max films without a need to have SEEN them all to understand what the heck is going on.",4
  Best action movie ever!,5
  One of the best action movies of all time instant classic,5
"  Mad Max: Fury Road exemplifies what a pure action film should be. Rather than having the action sequences support the story, it's the action that dominates the film. And the action was done authentically and with style. This is a film where you would want to watch over and over again just for the visual experience. In addition, the plot was straightforward and doesn't overindulge the audience in any way. The backstories of the characters weren't covered in the film, however, it is clear that during each character's short stage time, a complex past can be inferred from their concise dialogues, costumes, props, etc. (ex. Furiosa's robotic arm was never covered in the film because it does not support the main story, however, it is still in the film). Ultimately, this is a rare film where its creators had enough time to develop the story, characters, and action to last beyond its two-hour film time.",5
"  It's a fun ride, the craftmanship is stunning and the cast is good. If you like stylish action with art this is perfect for you.",4
  This 8s the greatest movie ever and U haven't even seen it.,0
  perfect for it's own kind of movies,5
  Mad Max Fury Road is movie making at its very best!,5
"  George Miller makes a triumphant return with this hardcore non-stop thrill-ride. Fans of the original Mad Max films will be filled with glee, while newcomers will also be won over. Hardy has an amazingly demanding presence as the iconic role, sometimes by not even speaking. And Theron plays the most badass heroine in any film of recent memory. The unique cinematography is a pleasure to watch, and its practical-effects for every action-sequence are jaw-dropping. The amazing stunts and successfully conveyed themes of feminism, religion, and tyranny, make it one of the greatest action films in the passed 20 years.",5
  George Miller revives his long dead franchise with new found energy and narrative heist and nonstop action scenes. Mad Max's apocalyptic franchise comes roaring vigorously back to life. While being exciting and visual pleasurable to watch.,5
  Beautifully looking and exhilarating. Just a thrill to watch as George Miller and Tom Hardy bring this series back to life with this modern classic.,5
"  Contentless bonanza of superfluous explosions masquerading as a plot. Literally a car chase.One dimensional, caricatured characterisation. Distressingly frenetic edit. Did not bang. All in all, resoundingly undeserving of 6th place on 'Best Ever Films' list.",1
"  Mad Max is back in this Sequel/Reboot that blows the other Mad Max films out of the water, In a matter of fact it blows most action films out of the water too, This beautifully shot masterpiece has some of the best action scenes, Car chases and stunts that I've ever seen, It hardly slows down for nothing but when it does we do have an interesting but familiar plot that works very well, Tom Hardy was great fun as Max I wouldn't mind seeing him take up the role again, The effects and practical effects were all amazing, I can't comment on the 3D as I watched the 2D version but I'm betting the 3D would of been great, It's not often a film lives up to the hype but Fury Road is a film that all action fans should watch as it's a modern day classic in many ways.",5
"  One of the best films i've ever seen was on the edge of my seat throughout everything was amazing the music, cars the action all brilliant!",5
"  One of the most thrilling EXPERIENCES I have ever had in a movie theater. The movie looks, sounds and feels fantastic.",5
"  This movie is a joke and an insult to the Road Warrior. In addition to not having a plot, isn't it ironic that nobody ever runs out of gas even after driving ridiculous monster trucks for 24hours straight, considering that's what the Road Warrior was all about...fuel. Bad acting, fake looking cinematography, girl power, total ripoff off the Road Warrior, perfect tires and shiny new vehicles in a post apocalyptic world, and....milk? I'm embarrassed for the director, he obviously has the same syndrome as George Lucas (A New Hope/Mad Max, Empire Strikes Back/Road Warrior, Return of the Jedi/Beyond Thunderdome, and finally Jar Jar Binks/Fury Road), first movie good, second movie better, third movie worst, and fourth movie being a complete disgrace to the franchise. I rest my case.",0
"  Radically well Shot, acted, edited and just downright fun to watch",4
"  The finest practical vehicle-based action sequences since Indiana Jones first chased after the Ark of the Covenant. This is one seriously incredible action movie!At 70-years-old Dr. George Miller is crafting more exciting and original action scenes than any young action filmmaker working in the studio system today. Because he focuses on the thing that big blockbuster action flicks so easily forget: tension. There is a near constant state of tension and fear for our heroes throughout this movie.It's also an action movie with more than one thing to say. This isn't just about telling a good story, it's also about respect for human life, even in the midst of complete and utter chaos. It's also about hope, seeking redemption, and caring for others above yourself.This is an action movie with heart, purpose, and the most bonkers (but coherently shot and edited) action sequences you're likely to see this year! It's the kind of risky, bold, and exciting action entertainment that Hollywood just doesn't make anymore. It's miles ahead of Avengers! Go see it!",5
  I was excited to see this movie but it didn't live up to expectations for me personally.,2
"  To put it simply, Mad Max: Fury Road is one gigantic pile of vibrant colors (in particular, desert orange and deep blue), metallic clamor, and a whole bunch of insanity, and I love every single second of it! When I first watched it in the theater, I felt like the movie had grabbed me by the throat and didn't let go until the end. Now, a few years later, even though I know what turns the movie makes, I still get a sense of satisfaction watching it. One sign of a good movie is that it keeps getting better each time you watch it; I've rewatched Fury Road many times since its theatrical release, but I haven't yet grown tired of Max, Furiosa, the wives, Nux, and Immortan Joe and his cronies. This is a truly remarkable film for the action genre.",5
"  Simply action-packed. A great start if you're new to the franchise. Everything is so fast-paced that I feel I have to watch this multiple times to figure out the plot. But nevertheless, the costume design, and special effects are great, no wonder this movie won more than one Oscar. I will have to check out the older films.",4
"  Mad Max: Fury Road seems set to become a classic action movie like Terminator 2 and Die Hard that you can watch again and again. The premise is somewhat simple but the execution is excellent and the film actually has something to say. In a post apocalyptic world, gasoline is of great importance and water has become a luxury horded by tyrants like Immortan Joe who enslaves and uses young men as war boys to fight & die for him and young, healthy women as wives to be used as breeders. Max, played by Tom Hardy, is captured by the war boys and is used as a 'blood bag' for one of the war boys, Nux, played by Nicholas Hoult. On a run for gasoline, the driver of a huge, armoured 'war rig', Furiosa, played by Charlize Theron, drives off course and it's discovered to have helped It Joe's wives escape and that's when the shit really hits the fan. This film is beautifully shot, with great costumes and the action in this film is incredibly well done, with the majority being practical stunts and effects in an almost relentless car chase that keeps ramping up the tension and the excitement. For an action movie, Mad Max has a surprising amount of depth and story to it and brings us a great new female action hero, which are few and far between, in the form of Furiosa, whose story the film focuses on rather than Max. Overall, an incredibly fun, action packed film that's well worth watching the making of as well just for the stunts.",5
  If I had to recommend this movie for anything it would be for the grand final battle.,2
"  Merciful heavens... the action was so intense and nonstop that it felt like I was hyperventilating whilst on speed in the middle of an EF3 Tornado. Mad Max: Fury Road is utterly brilliant, the story is minimalist in all the right ways and lets be honest... Max was fine but this movie was owned by Charlize Theron as Furiosa. GODDAMN IT, Theron was too good in this movie! The stink and horribleness of Thunder Dome is gone and Mad Max is back in top form.",5
  Almost pure action and keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Loved the story too! Perfect movie in my eyes!,5
"  55%Saw this on 5/7/15Good, but extremely overrated. George Miller makes a great action movie, but kills the Mad Max character by giving him too little screen time. Mel Gibson was a better Mad Max. For better and worse, Charlize Theron's Furiosa always overshadows Mad Max. It's not Tom Hardy's fault, he just didn't have much to do here. Theron steals the show and Nicholas Hault is the second best character here. The film simply recreates a Road Warrior kind of Mad Max movie but with barely minimal plotting. For a film of $150 Million budget, Fury Road looks really cheap, although it has got some good action sequences here and there. The gun blazing wives are just a bunch of good looking chicks. The villain is extremely bad and is not even threatening. Mr Miller has directed the movie very well. I wish that they at least give Mad Max something to do in the possible sequels to this film.",2
"  Finally got to see this, and it's beautiful",5
"  Mad Max Fury Road has it all, folks...except for a Mel Gibson cameo...or is there one? You'll have to see for yourself. This movie delivers on every aspect: acting, filming, script, action, etc. It even hones in on some of the comedy of the original film series.",5
"  The action sequences in this movie are so ridiculous and over-the-top, it's incredible how the filmmakers still took the time to use their visuals to move plot points forward and the make the action creative. The main characters are mostly likable, if not very developed (except Nux and Furiosa; I liked these two characters the most). 8/10",4
"  George Miller's Mad Max Fury Road has put modern action films to shame. With gorgeous wide shots of destruction, a near constant sense of urgency, good characters and a suprisingly solitd story, Mad Max Fury Road will be one of the gold standards for action movies for years to come.",5
"  Not only has it got a surprisingly meaty story and a great cast, but is also incredibly entertaining with outrageous action sequences, stunningly creative costume and set design, and ridiculously eye-popping visuals. It's a sight to behold and one of the best to come out of the Action genre in recent years.",4
"  Mad Max: Fury Road is iconic action filmmaking released in a time where CGI, F/X, and all other bits of technological visuals have been dominating the Hollywood scene. Director George Miller proves action can still be as exhilarating, unique, and narratively profound through practical effects and by using action as a vessel to his overall story. Fury Road not only demands constant attention to the small, non-verbal narrative details, but also requires some thought process. Viewers should not be surprised if they're still finding details in their third or fourth viewing that they didn't find previously--a feat that many hollow action films should've aimed for. Tom Hardy gives a superb performance in a role Mel Gibson left behind, but it is Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa that steals the screen, and our hearts as one of the more memorable characters in any Mad Max Film. For those who haven't previously seen a Mad Max film, I would definitely encourage them to check out the first and/or second film, but Fury Road can be watched and mostly understood on its own.",5
  A thrilling and superbly shot film that conveys this bleak world quite perfectly.,5
"  GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Scott, I thought we were done with the Fast and Furious series. Now we have Fury Road?SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Movie audiences appear to be clamoring for movies filled with endless car chases. And with great fury and furiousness. Let s recap.GREG: In a future world where gas and water are scarce, we re introduced to Mad Max. Max was apparently some sort of police officer who was charged with protecting women and children. We learn this through flashbacks of little girls asking Max why didn t you save us in accusatory tones. Max is taken hostage by the wild boys and hung from his heels in a cavern.SCOTT: We then see Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) secretly steal five breeding wives of the tyrannical and maniacal Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Joe and his henchmen give chase using a strange assortment of battle-equipped vehicles with Max strapped to the hood of War Boy Nux s (Nicholas Hoult) car. Soon Max escapes and joins forces with Furiosa in an attempt to find a way home and to safety.GREG: Scott, this movie was one long chase scene. There was hardly any time to create a plot. But there is one. Furiosa is trying to get these five young woman back to her homeland - The Green Place. When they arrive the land is dead and the only alternative is to go back where they came from. It s a very basic story, just enough to justify all the car mania. I have to say, though, I was impressed. It s dazzling display of roadwork and a nightmarish vision of the future. Most people I ve talked to were impressed by two things: the guy playing electric guitar on the front of a war vehicle, and how hot Charlize Theron looked despite being hairless and having just one arm.SCOTT: Greg, Mad Max: Fury Road is a stunning technical and action-adventure achievement. The look of the movie is unlike anything I ve ever seen. The surreal visuals of the characters and their bizarre motor vehicles are simply incomparable. This dystopian vision of humanity s future is disturbing yet creatively appealing. Now, having said that, I was disappointed with the complete lack of character development and storyline. We are never introduced to the main characters. These characters just show up and are being chased, hounded, and tortured by Immortan Joe and his minions. I suppose I should root for them because they seem less dislikeable and bizarre than Joe and his gang, but we have no way of knowing if they are worthy of our support. There simply is no backstory to any of these characters. All we have is one heart-palpitating car chase scene after another. Yes, these chases were fun, but I hoped for much more from a storyline and character development point of view.GREG: The star of this film was definitely the world created by director George Miller and writers McCarthy and Lathouris. We can only judge the characters by what they do, rather than what they might say. Max spends most of his time in the movie being victimized by others. He shows he s not a bad guy because instead of killing Furiosa when he has the chance, he merely shoots the sand around her. He s not a killer it seems. Later, when he has the chance to go his own way, he instead chases down Furiosa and her clan to convince them they are going the wrong way. Then he helps them to create a plan to return to the Citadel where there is ample food, water, and gas. So, he s a good guy after all, but we can only learn this through his choices rather than anything he says.SCOTT: I agree that Max and Furiosa follow the arc of the buddy hero story, in that they are two people thrown together who dislike each other at first but slowly develop a strong bond. The villains in this story depart from the usual pattern that we see in the movies, Greg. Usually, the mastermind villain (in this case, Immortan Joe) is a man who calls all the shots from afar, safe from any harm. Only his minions and henchmen come in harm s way. But in this movie, Joe is in on the action in a big way, and he ultimately gets his comeuppance at the end. Overall, the supporting cast is as memorable if not more memorable than our two heroes. This may be the case partly because the two main characters are so poorly developed, but also because the supporting cast members show some depth, not to mention unusual behaviors and vivid makeup and costuming. Props go out to Immortan Joe and Slit as the memorable villains, and to the friends and allies of our two buddy heroes. Specifically, the five breeding women and Nux, the bad-guy-turned-good-guy.GREG: It s interesting to see the transformation in a secondary character such as Nux. He starts out literally living off of Max s blood and chasing the escaping brides. He s a bad guy being lead by a dark mentor (Joe). But he soon falls in love with one of the brides and becomes one of the good guys. Here is a secondary character who undergoes a moral transformation. In the end he martyrs himself to save Max, Furiosa, and the remaining brides. He is a heroic, redeemed sidekick. I enjoyed Mad Max: Fury Road more than I expected to. Despite the lack of plot I was entertained by the imaginative and detailed dystopian future created by director Miller. I was drawn into the relentless chase and was able to appreciate the transformation of our buddy heroes as well as the sidekick. I give Mad Max 3 out of 5 Reels. While Max and Furiosa don t really create an alliance until the midpoint of the story, it s clear we re witness to a convergent buddy story. Our two heroes couldn t be farther apart at the beginning of the movie. But their common desire to escape the villain Immortan Joe and find a safe place draws them together. I liked this buddy story and gave them 4 out of 5 Heroes. The supporting cast was interesting as well. I ve already talked about the evolution of sidekick Nux. The five brides pretty much played the damsels in distress. Aside from an occasional opportunity to reload guns, their job was to look beautiful and be rescued. The villains were more interesting than usual. Immortan Joe certainly played the classic mastermind villain (although as you point out, Scott, he definitely got his hands dirty). Joe had his own henchman in Slit and countless nameless and faceless minions. But there was a nice addition of three other factions of bad guys, each with their own mastermind villain.Two warring factions came to Joe s aid, and the gas guzzling motorcycle gang chimed in to help our heroes. Sadly, we didn t get much depth to their characters, so I give the supporting cast 3 out of 5 Cast points. Movie: Cast: Hero: SCOTT: Mad Max: Fury Road is a visual spectacle and dazzling feast for the eyes and ears. But there is little substance in the form of storyline and character development. If you enjoy the Fast and Furious franchise, you ll enjoy this movie. I ll give this this film credit for being highly memorable in terms of make-up, costuming, cinematography, and visual effects. But I can t give any movie high marks without good meaty characters that we get to know. As a result, I can only award Mad Max: Fury Road 2 Reels out of 5. Our two buddy heroes, Max and Furiosa, were disappointing because we never get to know them. There is no backstory and almost no dialogue whatsoever that can give us insight into their values, their history, or their character. As such, they do not change over the course of the movie, other than they grow to like each other and depend on each other for survival. Let s face it -- this is an action movie that assumes (perhaps correctly) that audiences only want chase scenes. I can only award these two flimsy heroes 1 Hero out of 5. The supporting cast was more interesting than our two heroes. We re not given much insight about Immortan Joe or any backstory, either. But he is obviously a deranged, maniacal cult leader with loads of charisma. Max and Furiosa s friends and allies play a nice supporting role, and as you point out, Greg, Nux is the one character (albeit a supporting character) who undergoes a transformation. I ll agree with your rating and assign this group a rating of 3 Casts out of 5. Movie: Cast: Hero:",2
  Visually impressive with a fairly involving story for the genre.,4
"  This a fantastic, fast-paced action film that is visually spectacular. Storyline isn't exactly original or sophisticated, but it's a complete film nonetheless with top notch execution.",4
  Super Intense Action. Better than 'The Road Warrior',4
"  This is my new favorite movie. The score is one of the best I've heard in my life, and the way it pairs with the visuals takes it to a whole new level.The caliber of non-verbal acting that Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy achieve is the best I think I'll probably ever see. The evolution of their characters as they reluctantly come to rely on the other being there is palpable, and the lack of dialogue in the beginning throws that into sharper contrast.I can see how a die-hard Mad Max fan wouldn't like it because it's not about Max. But if you let that go and accept it for what it is - an independent story from Mel Gibson's character - you open yourself to a mind-blowing cinematic experience. The amount of care and attention to detail in the vehicles and the stunts is very rare in the age of digital enhancement, and you can tell the difference. The more I learn about this movie, the more I come to respect and appreciate all the scenes.This is a movie you can watch over and over again, and still not be able to tear your eyes away from the screen.",5
  There won't be another action movie like this one. Mad max fury road is an intense journey that you want to repeat again and again...,5
  a masterpiece. one of the best and grittiest action movies. just non stop action.and great performances.,4
"  The best action film since The Dark Knight, Fury Road unexpectedly became a smart film delivered in an awesome narrative. And has some damn good explosions too! Take that, Michael Bay!",5
  Super entertaining blockbuster that is action packed and full of visual scenes. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are terrific and with the thrilling direction of George Miller the film keeps you engaged throughout.,4
"  Crazy, over-the-top, action and violence! This movie is great on every scale!",5
  One of the best action movies I've ever seen.,5
"  Awesome, gritty, spectacular, wonderfully acted and a fantastic engaging story. Definitely One of the best action films ever made!!!",5
"  Edging out The Force Awakens for the best movie of 2015, Fury Road brings the franchise back to life with a vengeance. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron steal the show with Oscar-worthy performances, and the action is some of the best ever put to film. Combine that with an intelligent script and a simple but effective story, and you have one of the best action films of all time.",5
"  The action in this movie is awesome, Tom Hardy played his character well.",5
"  One of the most visually stunning, dynamic, well-paced & well-written movies I've ever seen. It's one that you'll remember for years.",5
  How did this movie score such a high rating? It was AWFUL!,0
"  Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) C-120m. ?? D: George Miller. Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, Hugh Keays-Byrne. Loud, headache-inducing Mad Max adventure (fourth after BEYOND THUNDERDOME) follows relentless rebellion against disgusting tyrannical ruler in post-apocalyptic Australia with help of (mostly inaudible) loner Hardy. Lots of fireworks but little magic; hard to care about a movie with such perfunctory characterizations and plodding, unimaginative story. Super-production but lack of humanity hurt the effort. Larger in scale than other films in series, but bigness doesn't equal greatness. Great names, though: Rictus Erectus, Toast the Knowing, etc.",2
"  It was a Mad Max movie, without Max. That is, once you get about a third through. The beginning was a Road Warrior-esque adrenaline shot, with an enticing plot introduction that has you wondering just how and what Max will do to stop Immortan Joe dead in his tracks. Then, you meet the wives, and especially, Furiosa. Soon after you forget that Max is even involved, because all he does is become a near-designated driver and action prop. All of a sudden, Furiosa is some maim character that we didn't ask for, but would have appreciated if the roles of her and Max were reversed. The wives are dead weight, another excuse just to make Joe slightly angrier and more motivated to stop Ma- well, Furiosa, when the rig would have been just fine to defend. Then there's this crash at the end that's a middle finger to the viewers",2
"  Hated it. Possibly the worst movie I've ever tried to watch. I almost got up and left. If you like car chases this is for you, a 2 hour car chase. And I like car chases. Oh, and it's not a Mad Max film either.",0
  Not really my scene but you can't fault the production values. Very loud but thrilling at times.,4
  Amazing. Incredible. Awesome. Action movie like we've never seen before. Great visual effects and great action sequences. Acting is spot on.,6
"  very good action scenes,the way the story is developed is interesting and the special effects are very good",5
"  Excellent!! Loved it,If you like excitement this is it!",5
  I loved the Mad Max films and that hasn't changed. What a perfect way to reboot.,5
"  Combining with breathtaking action sequences, good performances and some very good visual storytelling, Mad Max Fury Road is a truly thrilling and awesome action movie.",5
  An intense movie that leaves you clinging to the edge of your seat. An absolute must watch film.,5
"  Bland, emotionless, and tiresome, Mad Max: Fury Road provides viewers with a 2-hour long chase scene that may be as dry as the desert itself.",2
  A modern masterpiece of film making.,5
"  Certainly an immersive world, and I get why it is highly regarded, but it was not a film I enjoyed. There's essentially no character development/backstory/explication, and the plot is relayed exclusively through elaborate driving/fight sequences, which I space out on in essentially every action movie I watch. I liked the feminist stuff and the fact that it was almost not at all about romantic love, but this was not my movie.",4
  quite simply the best action film I have ever seen in my life,5
"  5/5 I don't really like to give 5 star reviews, but this was one movie that I really felt deserved it. I saw this in theaters and I've probably watched it 20+ times since then and it gets better with each viewing. Everything from the action to the setting is fantastic. Definitely one of my favorite films.",5
  Finally! I cant wait. I love the first 2 Mad Max films and I cant wait to see Fury Road.,5
  A complete and utter waste,2
  This movie is beautiful throughout the entirety of it's runtime.,5
"  In world of action flicks that consistently fail to create their own style, tone, or even story, George Miller's film towers above them all and shouts back down, ""Hey! See this? This is how you make an action movie!""",5
  The most action I ever saw in a movie. 90% of the stunts were real. It adds to the tension.,5
"  Really guys, why all the good ratings? Mad Max: Fury Road is a redundant, cliche, and exhausting reboot of the superior original films. Even if you are looking for just a mindless action movie, you may want to rethink stepping in line to grab a ticket. Here's why...We see Max, a man whose lost everything, including the title of main character in his own movie. Max is brushed aside to make way for a one-dimensional female character ""looking for redemption"" from....we don't really know. We also meet a character who gets more screen time then max and does absolutely nothing for the story.The ""action"" is insanely repetitive and never changes. There is no diversity between the antagonists and little character developement makes them all the more bland. The struggles becomes more and more anti-climactic because of the obvious ending to each situation. the good guy is in danger and, at the last moment, is saved; next scene. The visuals are quite good and the acting and dialogue are fine, but what kills the movie is the story line. there's no depth and it leaves nothing to the imagination. It leaves you with no suspense because it's a storyline that's been done before and we all know the ending.I'm all for reboots but please, writers, either stick to the story, or give us something fresh. I give it 2/5.",2
"  Is everyone going berserk? The critics and audience members who rated this highly are clearly sniffing too much gasoline. Raging adrenaline, testosterone, dystopian nonsense, and pointless, repetitive crazy a$$ chases to distract from lack of plot, character or redeeming values. Why are worthy actors like Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron in this? Maybe they thought this would be more fun to perform than it is to watch. Someone on bad drugs might get all hyped-up over this crazy crapola. But if your brain is still functioning and you have any shred of decency left in you, avoid this like the plague.",0
"  One of the most exhilarating films in recent memory. A franchise that seemed dead, gets revived with nonstop action. The film is gritty, with the atmosphere of the originals being perfectly captured, while also managing to surpass them.",4
  I usually like movies that are a little different. This was just weird and never really caught me.,2
"  An incredibly, ferocious film, George Miller has achieved making an iconic masterpiece that is thrilling for everyone.",5
  Heartwrenching character development and edge of seat action. I am very pleasantly surprised.,5
  A beautiful mess of cinematic achievement.,5
  Just a perfect movie,5
"  Has some good practical effects and action, but its lack of plot and character development causes it to wear thin very quickly.",2
"  Easily one of the most overrated movies ever, ""Mad Max Fury Road"" looks cool but has a mediocre storyline. Mel Gibson's original trilogy deserves a better reboot than this mess",1
"  I'm going to have to be ""that guy"" and admit that I didn't like this as much on second viewing. I don't think my opinion about any of the parts has changed, but my relative weighting of their importance has shifted. I'll say right up front, I don't think this is a bad film. A lot of it is more than a little exceptional. The action scenes, especially the final chase, are incredible. It's pretty much everything else about it that I could do without. The story and characters are pretty dumb. That's not a new thing ... it's pretty much true of all the films in this series, and it's what really buries the 3rd one. But in past films, none of the bad elements are amped up to absurd levels through the use of excessive CGI and a ridiculously frenetic pace. If you consider ""The Road Warrior"", that film's grounding in a very real seeming physicality gives it's broad sketchy characters the aura of archetypes. It's like a post apocalyptic western. This film feels like a cartoon, or maybe a video game. A really really good one, but still ... a video game.",4
  Saw it in theaters twice. One of my favorite movies ever. It deserves more praise than it gets because it is truly spectacular!,5
"  I do not like this type of film. I don't think it really showcases Tom Hardy's exceptional talent, but he sure knows how to create characters. I'd watch anything he is in and like it!",5
  Actions and visual effects are great.,4
"  Post-apocalyptic movies are awesome, but I absolutely enjoyed this one, Eventually I will watch its predecessors because it's an interesting world. Also.... I loved the music",5
  This is my first experience of the Mad Max franchise and had much to learn about its story. This movie taught me all i needed to know and its a bizarre world full of character and stunning imagery. Its a strange movie but one that keeps up an impeccable pace and is full of brutal action. Really the whole movie feels like one massive racing scene and on reflection not much happens but the full 2 hours is a fully entertaining adrenaline rush. Im positive this is a movie which can be enjoyed by all due to its unique style and extensive entertainment value.,4
"  George Miller's, Mad Max Fury Road is a visually thrilling film for the audience to enjoy and view. The first thing to come up through my mind when I first saw the cover for the film I knew that it was going to be very action-packed. And the film would be set in a desert location. The obvious main character in the film is Max since his name appears in the title and he does most of the fighting. The intro scene of Mad Max Fury Road introduces the audience to Max as he is seen with having a troubled past when he loses all his family and friends. However, Furiosa can also be considered to be a main character as she has the role of commander of the war boys and helps Max throughout his journey. Both characters Max and Furiosa aren't one dimensional which is good because it improves the storyline and doesn't make the film boring/uninteresting. Violence in Mad Max Fury Road is required most of the time to fend off some of the war boys, however in situations such as; when Max wanted to have water and his chains taken off him violence wasn't required he just wanted full control of the wives and Furiosa. The film itself is trying to convey an environmental message, but I doubt this is either believable or realistic to the audience as water is a renewable source and wouldn't be limited resource in the future. Mad Max Fury Road is trying to convey a environmental message of how the future may become like the scenery of Mad Max Fury Road if we humans don't conserve resources like gasoline and oil.In most cases, Mad Max Fury Road isn't feminist because the women are treated poorly and don't have the roles men do. Although Furiosa is portrayed as a strong character with a lot of power and the film passes the bechel test meaning the film has more than two women and the women talk about topics other than men.Overall, Mad Max Fury Road is a great film with many thrilling action scenes and great fighting scenes, but with minor tweaks here and there it could have been more realistic or believable to the audience viewing the film.",4
"  Mad Max Fury Road reviewAs we started watching Mad Max Fury Road, I had the vibe that this movie was going to be a boring action fiction movie and definitely not going to amuse me and be boring. I do enjoy action movies but from looking at the setting and reading up what it was about, I didn't see that I would enjoy it whatsoever and I wasn't enjoying it at the start. The main character in Mad Max Fury Road is deal was made about the fact that the lead character of the film was a woman, but according to George Miller it had to be that way. When what is being fought over is women, it needed to be a woman who does the fighting. Overall, Furiosa had to be the main character in order to make the story make sense and work. Violence is needed in this film because the plot of fury Road involves many fight and action scenes which leads to violence. It isn't a problem in the movie because it structures the movie together and without violence, I guess the movies wouldn't be that entertaining and wouldn't make sense. As you can tell after watching the full movie, it is 100 percent an unrealistic movie but, that does not matter because miller has set Fury Road in a future desert wasteland where gasoline and water are scarce. What I think millers message is in this movie is that he is telling us what he thinks the future may turn to. As it may seem a little too unbelievable, just remember that aliens are believed to be a myth but yet some in fact many, still believe that they are real existing creatures so who knows. Maybe millers prediction of the future is correct and our country or even earth will turn into a desert wasteland. As said before, feminism does work in the film because Furiosa (the main character) leads and takes risks which is showing the woman are worth the same as men and they are Miller is sending a messages out to the world that the world should be equal and proves that women are strong and can do dangerous and risky things that men can do too. Overall, I did enjoy the film and my opinion of the film changed dramatically from the beginning which is a good thing and means that you have to watch the whole film to enjoy it you can't just watch the trailer to come up with your opinion.",4
"  While I was watching Mad Max, I felt engaged and drawn into the action, I wanted to keep watching the film more and more as it went on. It made me think about the world and its devastation, and who was responsible for the cause of the world's corruption.Max is supposedly the main character because his name is in the title and the storyline originally revolved around him and his fight for justice. Furiosa also plays a big part in the movie as Max's ally and Max spends a lot of time trying to help himself and Furiosa survive. The minimum dialogue has no effect on their portrayal as their actions speak louder than words. I can see depth in both of these characters as their past that has made them who they are.In the film, violence is always used to solve problems and I don't think that these problems could be solved any other way. The violence is a vital part of the movie and it is necessary as the characters are beyond verbal negotiation and have to resort to violence. Some of the violence is unrealistic, such as the weapons that they use and how the vehicles are made. The setting is supposed to be the world's future, but I think we will be able to solve our problems with communication and negotiation so that we share the resources fairly. I don't think it matters how realistic and extreme the vision of the future is because it is only for us to watch and enjoy. The film could be saying that we need to make the unsustainable resources last as long as possible so the planet doesn't become corrupt. I think it is great how the film shows how women have as much strength as men. Furiosa and the Breeders prove their strength by fighting off the war boys and Immortan Joe. Furiosa is technically the main character and she is using her strength and power to free the Breeders and herself from Immortan Joe's captivity.Overall, I enjoyed the film immensely as it was filled with action and engaging moments, keeping me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend watching the first 3 Mad Max films before this one, to understand Max's journey.",4
"  This movie has action out the ass like there's no tomorrow. 90% action, 10% dialogue. Not really what makes movies that great, but the film was entertaining to watch and Theron's character was one fierce mutha-efer. Great movie, but one-time-watch sort of ordeals.",4
  Superb action and special effects,4
"  George Miller's, Mad Max Fury Road is a visually thrilling film for the audience to enjoy and view. The storyline is just amazing, to be able to see the main protagonist; Furiosa take us through her journey to the 'green land'. And then she and other main characters such as Max was found to be making a drastic attempt to have control over the citadel. The locations where Mad Max Fury Road is filmed couldn't be any better as the location is best placed for a film with having to get vital needs such as a quiet desert. Mad Max Fury Road is very profitable as it had a hefty budget of 200 million dollars during the production of the film, with their worldwide box gaining over 300 million dollars.",5
  Top 3 action movies all time.,5
"  The action movie of action movies. Put two acting gods, Hardy, Theron, together and they skyrocket Fury Road into cinematic heaven. Miller directs the sh*t out of this movie and it is GREAT. His touches are unmissable: quick, dirty, anxious. Not to mention the story. Action has never met an apocalyptic plot so fit for the genre. Somehow, Mad Max marries a somewhat brain-dead movie drama into a thought provoking and meaningful story, leaving moviegoers like me intrigued and actually emotionally interested in these characters and the resolution of the film. Visually? A+. Grimy, stylistic masterpiece. I could feel the dry heat of that desert! Deserves all that Oscar talk. My only complaint was probably the ending-i was left unfulfilled after an extremely satisfying action sequence-what gives?",4
"  Well, that's a couple hours if my life I won't get back. It starts off with violence and ends that way. The movie is one long car chase with lots of bloody crashes. Plus there's a group of nubile scantily clad young women needing to be rescued ( but that doesn't become apparantly for a while). The plot is vague, the characters undeveloped. I would have been interested in who the group of women are, and what happenedto their land. This was flat out awful. Don't waste your time!!!",0
"  On the surface, Mad Max Fury Road is a violent, thrilling, and beautiful action masterpiece that is enjoyable and entertaining to witness. But beneath that surface, George Miller places striking and true social commentaries on the behaviors hidden deep within society today. There was not one slow or dull part of this movie, and I had a hell of a time experiencing it for myself. An instant action classic!!!",5

"  Long was the wait, actually I stopped waiting and simply gave up on it, but George Miller in the end was given the chance to make a new Mad Max movie and this is it. I don't know the last time I was so swept away by a movie this visceral. The passion into making this by ALL involved bursts from every frame and we can only marvel at its existence and be thankful. Charlize Theron is granted a life time pass in my book because of this movie and of course she is the real lead. Max is a bit of a cyphre and not really present that much to the viewer. Nux knocks it out of the park though, but none of it would have come accross the way it so overwhelmingly did without George Miller at the helm.I'm very grateful for this movie and will revisit many, many times",5
  Three Original and Remake are two similar but distinctly enjoyable stories. This classic leaves a little more to the imagination with a mysterious suspense.,4
  Visually outstanding this is what an action movie should be. Mixing practical and CG effects in perfect amounts it has a solid story and makes me long for more.,4
"  Great movie! Loved the characters, reminds me a lot of borderlands 2 video game villains.",5
  Highly recommended if you want to see a sick non-stop action movie! It will melt your face off,0
  A great spectacular explosion of nonsense. No story or character development. Max plays second fiddle to the real star Charlize Theron. The movie is one over long chase scene afrom point A to point B and back to point A again. I'm giving it a star for the vehicles and costumes. Is this what gets almost 100% on the tomato meter these days?,1
  WOW!!! Just WOW! This movie is awesome!!!! So entertaining!!!!,5
"  Absolutely insane reviews. It's a popcorn flick with little storyline that's been told much better in other wasteland future flicks including some of the oldest Anime in existence like Fist of the North Star. You have to lower your expectations to such abysmal levels and forgive it more than several dozen times for it's inconsistancies and lack of realistic human death in such a dystopian future. What makes it all the worse, is the over praise of it. It's a fine waste of 2 hours, but don't expect humor, realism, depth, or even good action. B-movie with a high budget and no depth - if that's as low as your expectations are then you may enjoy it. I know how mine have dwindled to nothing out of hollywood and I still think this was just barely above shutting off.",2
"  Mad Max Fury Road is a modern day action masterpiece. I cannot praise Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron and the rest of the cast for creating such an amazing film. And of course the incredible George Miller. Mad Max Fury Road is an absolute Marvel in presentation, characters and most importantly action. I think it's best for me to leave it there because as you can tell Mad Max Fury Road is an absolutely incredible film which will go down in the books for a very long time. 5/5",5
"  Pure Movie. what a fantastic ride, watching this movie again and again....without even knowing the background story or other episodes of it...",5
"  No, there really is no plot and I don't think Tom Hardy remembered exactly how to speak, but this is just a technically good action film. It is pulled off brilliantly and my God are those car chase sequences orgasmic.",5
"  Thoroughly enjoyed this film. It is an action ride from start to finish and its high tempo rarely lets up. Great cast, visuals, stunts, story in a believable distopian world. I hadn't seen the originals but would recommend this for anyone who likes a high tempo film with a fair share of explosions and good acting.",5
  One of the best sci-fi/action films of the last 10 years.,5
"  No idea how this scored high, it's the biggest rubbish ever seen. Destroyed mad max forever. He's not even part of it, just a random sidekick. No story to speak of either. And acting was painfull.",0
"  Quite probably one of my favorite movies of all time. A perfect blend of hectic action and superb visuals that serve as a testament to the success of the ""show, don't tell"" direction of the story. An ideal virtuous circle between style and substance. Masterpiece",5
  Overrated I don't understand the high score the critics gave the movie. Critics like to pick and choose what movies doing G the same thjngs. I would compare this to transformers 4 as I stopped paying attention after 30 minutes of over the top action.,0
  Best Mad Max film? Yes. How it that possible? I don't know.,5
"  If The Dark Knight and Inception didn't exist, Mad Max: Fury Road would be the greatest action film ever made. I've never seen a film that made my blood pump with excitement before this one. The fact that most of the stunts were real makes my jaw drop, and the genius color palette is just beautiful to look at. Oh, what a movie! What a lovely movie!!!!!10/10",5
  Disappointing but still pretty entertaining,2
  Story is were? But the effect are good.,1
  Highly recommend!! My favorite movie of all time!!!,5
  From start to finish i was on the edge of my seat in this thrilling action packed film that takes you in to this world of chaos and mayhem. Mad Max Fury Road was an exciting film from start to finish that left me wanting more.,4
"  Dull. Could not finish. Loved the first movie, Mad Max",1
"  A visceral, post-apocalyptic Australian action all about survival. Unusual action series in that every installment is highly rated.",4
"  One of the best reboots out there. Riveting, visually original and loaded with action.",5
"  I just can't believe that in the wide world of critics, this loud raucous and largely plotless film got 98%. Where are the critics who after the first hour or so of loud engines and bloodlust aren't gonna say, ""Hey, wait a minute, what is this all for? The first of this franchise that saw was ""the Road Warrior"" and while it had its own share of blood n' roar, did have a relatively interesting storyline as well as the comic relief from the gyro pilot and the feral kid. This was just one grim deafening scene after another with some very poorly thought out ""twists"" such as (spoiler alert) the otherwise savvy Furiosa not having even the smarts of the not-so-genius Max in being able to figure out that driving for 160 days (with what fuel?) across a salt pan was not exactly a great plan. Hey, and given that even at a very low daily mileage of saw a couple of 100, that would have taken them 32,000 miles. Anybody ever heard of seas or that the earth has a circumference at its thickest point is less than that? Duh, seems to be a good one word summary for this noisy nonsense film",1
"  Mad Max: Fury Road is a sequel / reboot of the 1980's film franchise directed by original director George Miller. The film stars Tom Hardy (Max Rockatansky), Charlize Theron (Furiosa) and Nicholas Hoult (Nux). It has good acting from all of the actors involved however, Tom Hardy character does not have too much character development when compared to the rest of the cast. There are amazing balls to the wall action set pieces that are very well choreographed and beautiful to look at. This film is excellent but it has a very simple plot.",5
  This doesn't pretend to be anything other than an action film and that's why it works.,4
"  Fantastic FX is what makes this movie groundbreaking in a digitalized film industry. It should be a reminder to filmmakers that CGI should be used as a garnish, not the entire entrée. Intelligent director, George Miller, gave a purpose to every insane shtick in the story that people often like to regard as meaningless nonsense. Some of the voices in the audience say, ""too much action"" but I say that too much action in a Mad Max film is like complaining that you're getting more steak than you thought you were paying for. There is a plot and there are relatable characters who develop. Max Rockatansky is a man who has had a terrible life and has a guilt complex - I can name a lot of people like that. Furiosa is a redemption-seeking woman who seeks 'home.' Granted, the one complaint that is understandable is that the story has too much Furiosa and not enough Max. In my opinion, Max was important enough to the story and had enough screen time to count as a main character alongside Furiosa. It's of no surprise that the sound mixing and film/sound editing won Academy awards. The music provided by Junkie XL also kept the adrenaline pumping from behind the movie very well.Lastly, I'd like to note that Hugh Keays-Byrne made another excellent performance as a villain.",5
"  Mad Max: Fury Road is possibly one of the best action movies to come out of the 21st century, and already one of my favorite action movies of all time. George Miller put the Fury in Fury Road with this non-stop action edge of your seat never-ending thrill ride. It is one of the most wicked and exciting experiences you could ever have in cinema, for the movie is visually breathtaking, boasts incredible performances, and never loses you for a moment. There is no slow build-up, drag, or slow sequences. The second the movie starts, it gets right to what you want to see and keeps you there throughout the whole thing. With ingenious direction, eye-popping practical and visual effects, and mind-blowing sequences of high octane carnage, Mad Max truly is one of the gems.",5
  Good update of the original.. enjoyed it,4
"  Subtly explored themes of personhood, objectification, and feminism wrapped up in a gripping post apocalyptic action film.",4
"  Genius. Pure genius. Great action, great movie.",5
  It's amazing how they fit all that in 120 minutes,4
"  George Miller elevates action and violence to a true art form in this remake of a classic. The film is a gripping full adrenaline race across the desert of a post-apocalyptic future. The action sequences are mesmerizing and the work of a true master craftsman in action. What is perhaps the most enthralling part of the film is the absolutely absurd story and world building. Miller created a fantasy world where men playing flame throwing guitars and leaping through high speed chases on pull-vaults seems like a typical milk run. The movie keeps a relentless action pace that makes all of the absurdity seem so completely ordinary, which might be the real magic of this movie. This is only really possible because the action, filmography, set choices and music are so brilliant you cannot help but believe the insanity that plays out before you. You want to believe the fiction because of the quality of the production. The movie also features some surprisingly good performances. Charlize Theron being the real the star of the film, with the titular character really only acting as her support.",5
"  One of those movies that leaves you so amazed at what you just saw that you can barely speak. So intense, so fast-paced, so well choreographed, and looking so good that it cannot disappoint. After watching this, I re-watched Road Warrior, and that movie seems like a B-Movie in comparison. It hurts me to say that, but it's true.",5
"  This movie bored me to tears... The acting was horrid, the action was all over the place, and made no sense. The story.... Wait was there even a storyline? Horrible movie.",2
"  Unique, thoroughly entertaining, and above all - batshit insane.",4
"  Legitimately the worst movie i've ever seen in my entire life. The director put in a very transparent effort to make the movie modern, for example the Metallica-like ""rock star"" following them into battle. Half of the movie was completely laughable. Very much an unintentional comedy. Some of the details, like the silver spray paint they spray into their mouths before a mission, just completely don't make any sense. The entire movie was just one big pointless chase, without any context. So incredibly stupid.",0
  Action packed but not epic Tom Hardy's preformance was very average lost interest in the film within half an hour definitely don't recommend it.,2
"  Rating: 81%With strange but spectacular production designs and amazing action, Mad Max: Fury Road has no problem bringing back a once-dormant franchise back in play.",4
"  Beautiful film making on display but no substance.I had heard all manner of glorious things going into this film; George Miller's continuation of the infinitely praised mad max trilogy (let's forget the third one). It is immediately apparent while watching this movie that George miller and many other people behind this film are very talented. The standard of craft here is mind blowing; maintaining an expert blend of practicality and CGI to the extent in which it is often very hard to tell which is which. Additionally the editing is by far some of the best I've ever seen; entirely fluid but radical hops between shots. However, I simply couldn't get invested in the action, as I simply did not give the slightest inch of a shit as to what would become of the characters. No matter how phenomenal the destruction, no matter how absurdly drool worthy the wide shot, there was nothing pulling me to it because I could not relate to anyone in the film, and there was very little time and effort establishing the characters that inhabit this film. I also noticed that some of the dialogue is truly ridiculous. I am aware it is meant to be mental however if the glossy radical filter was stripped away from this film; many instances of character communication would just be comparable to idiots in a script run through screaming at each other, something that I just couldn't find myself enjoying. Believe me, I would have loved to give this film a higher rating than a mere half mark but since the script seemed to be incredibly boring it significantly reduced the impact of the clearly incredible stunts on display. As a result, I do not think this film is worthy of a higher star grade. If this was entirely based on the craft and direction; 5 stars would not be a problem at all for me. However, filmmaking is about what you say as well as how you say it.",2
"  Mad Max is a visually stunning masterpiece of the action genre, filled with fantastic practical effects and badass vehicle designs. While the story is a bit simple, it doesn't take away the fact that Mad Max: Fury Road is a heart-pounding thrill-ride of a film, with every viewing adding more appreciation to a film like this being created in a time of very bland action movies.",4
"  Strong female lead, stunning visuals...it's like Star Wars with cars!",5
"  Loved it, great fun!",4
"  Mad Max Fury Road suffers from pretty much everything most action movies suffer from, lack of character development, and a clear narrative.",1
  non-stop action... that's all ( i ain't complaining),5
  Non stop action that will leave your heart pounding at the end of the movie.,5
"  Mindnumbing. Overrated. Fury Road is a grotesque, dust-bowl carnage, sustained by the ecstatic, theological riff to ""Valhalla!"" Beyond that, this film's succinct and albeit original narrative has little else to say.",1
  Action packed adrenaline ride!Mad Max Fury Road gives you no break on the well coreographed action!,5
  I had to see this movie about 7 times ... and everytime I watch I can see why peeps love this film!!,4
  WOW! in UHD and Dolby Atmos this one is incredible!,5
  George Miller succeeds with this film. Unlike Micheal Bay and the Transgormers series George Miller has clearly stated that he is able to make 4 films that are of the same series. This film is exiting and will keep you at the edge of yor seat the whole film. Though there is not much dialogue the film somehow manages to grasp you just by the story I'm not even going to talk about the crazy stutns. The cinematography and sound effects are Oscar worthy. Furiousa may be the main character the film is still about Max. The acting is superb. It's worth seeing in 3d. But to understand the film completely you should see the first three films.,4
  This movie is sooo good. I had super high expectations and they were exceeded. This is a superb action flick brought many new fans to the franchise. And will always be one of my favorite movies. best action movie ever made. It's better and better each time you watch it. It made me cry of happiness!!!!,5
"  Great addition to the franchise, but Tom Hardy almost seemed like a side character.",4
"  I was very pleased to finally give this one a spin after missing it theatrically, but Holy Moses did all the hype pay off. This one starts off at a frenetic pace and keeps it going for most of the two hour running time, barely giving the audience a chance to catch its breath.This is great, energetic storytelling and a worthy successor to the original material.Recommended.",4
  I never expected a movie of this nature to be so emotional and engaging.,4
  Simply great especially in terms of visuals and masking.,5
"  At one point in George Miller's totally whacked out new film, a character proclaims: ""Oh, what a day ... what a lovely day!""If you end up watching this film as I did, chances are your day will be anything but that.Mad Max: Fury Road is a totally underwhelming experience, a film that promised so much but ended up flattering to deceive.George, who also created the Mad Max Trilogy of the 80's with Mel Gibson in the titular role, goes for the jugular this time, delivering a film that's high on adrenalin but short on nuance.Plot, you ask? Immortan Joe is a dictator who presides over his subjects with an iron hand.Water, guzzoline (and common sense) are in short supply.It falls upon a rebel, Imperator Furiosa, and Max himself to liberate the country from the clutches of Joe's oppression.In fact, Furiosa (Charlize Theron in a stellar turn) is the heart and soul of this enterprise. She completely owns the screen each time she appears on it, lending a sense of urgency and gracefulness to the film's proceedings.Tom Hardy, on the other hand, is completely out of sorts. He lacks the charisma and easy charm that a leading role of this nature would inevitably demand.The whole film is basically one long explosion-filled chase down a barren, dystopian landscape that could give Panem from Hunger Games a run for its money.Problem is, the aforementioned chase takes all of two exruciating, mind-numbing hours.Miller's vision is grand and has a sweeping quality to it. The same cannot be said for his execution.A good film goes far beyond just expensive CGI and VFX. It requires a solid script, cracking dialogue and characters whom you can empathise with and relate to.In his zest for making a film that redefines the action genre, Miller unfortunately seems to have overlooked this elementary fact.I could have slept through the entirety of this film's duration and it would hardly have made a difference.In the film's very beginning, Max says, ""My name is Max. My world is fire. And blood.""And boring, he might have added. This Road is full of potholes.",2
  Why did they call this Mad Max? The supposed anti-hero plays a bit roll in the movie. The female lead is just a little too butch to be believed. I am sorry to say between this and Mad Max 3 it is hard to decide which is worse. Stick with the first two Mad Max movies.,1
"  High intensity, Low in dialog adrenaline fueled masterpiece. Perfectly paced with memorable characters and settings. Stands on its own merits without the need of seeing the originals, although I do recommend seeing the originals. A must see.",5
"  I just don't see anything special about this overly odd, violent, and over the top action flick that did nothing to excite me, and at times made me laugh unintentionally.",1
  One of the few action films deserving of a 5 star rating.,5
  Thrilling ride from start to finish! Amazing journey with a good story curve out of one giant chase scene.,5
"  Awesome movie, not great work superb by George Miller.",5
"  Easily the most enjoyable, fantastical, women empowering film I've seen in my life. The acting, the characters, lighting, cinematography is all done with purpose. This will be my #1 movie for a long time.",0
"  With the blend of practical and CGI effects, beautiful cinematography and jaw dropping action, Mad Max: Fury Road is a welcome addition to the MAD MAX anthology",5
  I just want Furiosa to be my fiance. #Iloveher,5
  Super intense to the point that I felt exhausted watching it but visually unforgettable.,4
"  My kinf of action films , loved every minute of it .",5
  2 hours of relentless action and little development of storyline left me exhuasted.,0
  The action speaks for itself...,4
  Great movie...a thrill ride the whole way... great acting and stunts...special effects were awesome..,4
  max says like 4 words movie has nothing to do with mad max and there is the stupidest chase scene involving a guy playing a guitar ......totally stupid movie not titled mad max and minus guitar player scene it wouldn't have been that bad,0
  Cada nuevo visionado de esta película se convierte en toda una experiencia y mi opinión sobre ella mejora; así que solo puedo decir: PUTA OBRA MAESTRA. Ya está.,5
  How I've only just seen this is beyond me. should be a crime really.,5
  It all looked too bloody poished for my liking. Wanted to kill the guitarist,2
"  Amazing action and acting, maybe Tom Hardy deserved more scenes and lines but i still like it.",0
"  Mad max fury road is really good, it's so much fun and whatever that stuff",4
  Loved every minute of it .,5
  Well shot and highly entertaining.,5
"  When people imagine the classic films of the previous genration the answers are usually films like The Empire Strikes Back and Terminator 2 usually come to mind. When people ask what the classics of this generation were, Mad Max Fury Road will most certainly be one of them. This movie hits all of the notes that make a great action film in the 80s and makes it in present day. It has awesome characters, a fantastic musical score, and some of the practical best action, probably, of all time. This movie is a modern day masterpiece and when people look back on the great movies of this decade we will not look at Spotlight (which won best picture the same year this was nominated) as the biggest highlight, we will look back on Mad Max.",5
"  George Miller, the wonderful Australian director, struck gold with his comeback movie Mad Max: Fury Road. The marvelous choice of actors, with Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, and the wonderful camerawork, that seemed to cover every necessary angle for every battle, help explain how this movie left me on the edge on my seat. Mad Max gets things rolling by having Max crawl out from under his badass vehicle. The entire movie you get to see these amazing sand vehicles coming at you from every direction, trying to capture Max. When he escapes with ease from his first set of enemies, you start to realize that he's never going to be alone with a sense of safety (Literally, I don't think that there was ever a scene without an intense, high-speed chase). George Miller does a wonderful job of never letting you take your eyes off the movie. I think the production is what makes this movie fantastic. The camerawork, the terrain, and the backgrounds all provide nice, jaw-dropping scenes that give this movie life. I caught myself many times taking a step back and saying ""Damn, that's a nice shot there"". The first three Max Movies were all filmed in Melbourne, Australia and Mad Max: Fury Road was moved to the southern African country of Namibia. The lengthy scenes were filled with roaring trucks flying through the desert so you never wanted to look away. Shots are always filled with chaos and many antagonists that are just waiting to make their move. George Miller keeps the images and backgrounds coming at you like a meteor shower. One second you're looking at a huge sandstorm and the next you're looking at a battle filled with over 50 vehicles. The stunk work and tracking shots are unreal as it shows people flying off their vehicles left and right the whole movie. Max goes through the movie having constant flashbacks that hurt his ability to focus. These flashbacks consist of rapid, unsteady close-ups of his lost daughter. This aids to create a story that will also keep the non-action lovers craving more. Mad Max however has its fair share of funky, unnecessary scenes but the film doesn't seem to suffer from it at the slightest. Does every movie make sense the whole time? No, so just go with it and strap back in your seat and continue to watch the action-packed film. Before watching this movie, I didn't know what to expect... And even after watching it, I still couldn't tell you what was going on, but I weirdly was fond of that and how George Miller left me feeling a different type of way. This movie has its own personality and I think it might be years until a similar action film comes out. This movie won an Oscar, was nominated for numerous other ones, and after watching it, you can easily see why. Mad Max will leave you craving more so get ready for a new standard of action movies because you won't know what hit you. If you think that a scene is breathtaking in Mad Max, just wait about 5 minutes until the next one and I bet you'll be saying the same words.",5
"  This is the most insane film I've ever seen, but there is no real plot and is basically just a 2 hour chase film... I didn't really enjoy it",2
"  Ok so the special effects were great, but all the Mad Max films since the #2 in the original series Mad Max - Thunder Road have suffered by being lame attempts to repeat that success",2
  Great special effects however the plot is not as amazing as critics have made it seem,4
  Stunning. A cinema lesson.,5
"  Over the opening credits of Mad Max: Fury Road, our title character says in gravelly narration, ""my world is fire and blood"" and he could not be more right. Set in the same post-apocalyptic wasteland as The Road Warrior and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, where oil, gasoline, and water are scarce, but not as scarce as civilization, this adventure finds Max (Tom Hardy-brooding and often silent) as almost a side character to the main narrative. The action really kicks off when Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) smuggles a group of women away from their captor in her massive ""war rig"" and is pursued by countless bad guys in suped-up weaponized vehicles-and Max is forcibly brought along for the chase. That is about all the plot there is in the screenplay written by director George Miller with Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris, but with a film as well-executed in direction, cinematography, performances, visual effects, and costume and production design as this one, that is enough. The villain of Fury Road, Immortan Joe, (played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who was also a villain in 1979's Mad Max) is a cross between Darth Vader and Skeletor in appearance. He rules The Citadel with equal parts cruelty and tyranny, giving the people of The Citadel little water to live on and keeping women in a vault as his wives (or, put more bluntly, breeders). When he discovers Furiosa's betrayal, he sets out with a massive war party, including, most memorably, a barge stacked with amplifiers and speakers and a man whose sole purpose is to play heavy metal riffs on a flame-throwing guitar. Immortan Joe's minions are shirtless, chalk-painted men called War Boys, desperate to impress their leader and die gloriously on the Fury Road. Max, being ""a Road Warrior searching for a righteous cause"" after all, eventually decides, albeit reluctantly, to help Furiosa, but not until after they have an intense fight in the desert with the war party quickly closing in and Max chained to both a car door and a War Boy called Nux (Nicholas Hoult). However, despite Fury Road being nominally Max's adventure, it is Furiosa's mission which drives the story. She is our main character and Theron-who can perhaps be best described as ""super badass""-is the real star and standout in this movie. Her performance is quiet, but perfectly measured; and our emotions-yes, there are emotions in Fury Road-are invested with her. It might seem odd to call the gritty, violent, high-octane Fury Road a feminist action movie, but that argument is not a difficult one to make. Max does his fair share of driving and killing, but he does not swing in to rescue these women-they are equally his saviors. The group of young women led by Furiosa are not damsels in distress and this movie makes each of them feel like a full person and treats them accordingly. Though they are not all experienced road warriors like Furiosa, the women display other strengths like bravery and compassion. When one of the escapees, Capable (Riley Keough), finds Nux in the back of their War Rig, curled up in shame and humiliation at having failed Immortan Joe, she convinces him through gentle conversation to become an ally in their escape. Fury Road is a movie about women rescuing other women from male cruelty. Though Fury Road is essentially one big, unrelenting chase, Miller finds ways to give the audience moments of respite and a chance to breathe. One of my favorite scenes in the movie happens when our protagonists' flight comes to a halt. The engines of the War Rig have overheated and must cool down before they can continue, but Immortan Joe's forces are only getting closer. Max gathers his weapons and begins to walk toward the pursuing villains. Furiosa asks, ""What if you're not back by the time the engines are cool?"" Max quietly replies, ""Well, you keep moving"" and sets out into the blue tinged night. A battle ensues-we hear gunshots, but rather than jumping into the middle of the fight we stay with Furiosa and watch from a distance.When watching Fury Road, you get the impression that George Miller was mostly left alone with little to no studio interference or notes from the marketing department. There are many unpleasant, grotesque images in this movie, but there are also many fascinating and exciting ones, too. The costume design, production design, makeup and hairstyling, and visual effects are all deservedly nominated for Oscars. Watching Fury Road again I noticed more and more intricate and impressive details. The score by Junkie XL was not nominated for an Oscar, but it is a great nonetheless, and used to perfection. Fury Road feels like it was a true collaboration between all of the people involved with the production both on and off camera. This fourth installment in the Mad Max series comes 30 years after the third, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, and for fans of the earlier films Fury Road does not disappoint. However, you don't need to have seen any of the other Mad Max films to enjoy this one, since each film has its own standalone story which is explained and changed slightly at the opening of each movie. I was immensely entertained when I saw this film in theaters and again when I saw it on DVD. Everything I had enjoyed about the film the first time still had the same effect on me and my excitement for the film has not waned. This is an epic film of tremendous quality, which is usually not the case with big budget summer action movies or sequels. Fury Road is a full bore, action movie executed with noticeable care and meticulous thought at every turn.",4
  With lots of thrills and top notch action sequences Mad Max Fury road never fails to disappoint.,5
  Excellent follow up to the original films,4
  George Miller's force awakens,5
"  Mad Max: Fury Road is a pulse-pounding, non-stop thrill ride that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat from beginning to end without forgetting to get us invested in the characters. While the plot is simple, the set pieces are lovely to look at and the action is exhilarating. The performances - especially Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy - are pretty solid too. It holds your attention throughout, even if you haven't seen the originals, and should leave Action fans immensely satisfied. Overall, while it is somewhat light on plot, Mad Max: Fury Road compensates with a fast-paced plot, memorable characters and terrific action. Oh what a movie... what a lovely movie!",4
  One of the best action films ever!,5
  Found this really hard work......,2
  Really enjoyed it tom hardy was excellent in the of mad max,4
  The greatest action movie ever made.,5
  One of the best movies ever made!,5
  Absolute garbage. The only remarkable aspect of this production might be how the marketing department managed to fool so many people they were in for some sort of progressive feminist action flick. It is not.,1
  What nonsensical drivel. Boring and silly.,1
"  I don't get it. I am a huge Mad Max fan from way back. I had high hopes for this movie and it is just plain AWFUL. The acting is wooden and script is weak, the premise is lacking. MAJOR disappointment. I think it's popularity is due to people just wanting to jump on the band wagon and feel part of the group think.So SAD!!!",1
  Love everything about this movie. Insane crazy choreographed action all the way through.,5
"  It's been a long time since I saw the first movie of Mad Max that featured Mel Gibson. In this one, we have Tom Hardy to play as lone wanderer with a traumatic past.The cinematography is absolutely amazing. Love how they blend in the contrast in every scene and the characters were colorful within. I'm just glad there were no shaky cameras in this movie. Vehicle scenes were really, really good. I think it's hard to pull off such scenes because the actors have to interact perfectly to set things in motion and preventing to get a lot of takes. I was aware that the movie was in development hell but I'm glad it finally came out and it's a really good movie.Surprisingly it's a continuation of the overall story of Mad Max. I haven't watched the rest except first one and like I said before, it's been a real long time. But I do remember how hardcore Mad Max is and he is a force to be reckoned with. Something about lone wanderers and their calm before the storm attitude that makes them stand out from the others.Charlize Theron. Oh what a gal. Love her performance as always. A pretty good actress in a pretty good movie. I can't describe well anymore than I already can but to say that she adds the spice into the whole story of the Fury Road. Made her character tough as nails and would do anything to bring the oppressed girls to safe haven. One thing I didn't like much but it's probably just me is there was not enough Mad Max but I guess it's not bad to give other characters the spotlight and while we know Mad Max is just coming along for the ride. Surviving day by day, of course. While that was just my gripe, overall the movie is great nevertheless.Mad Max Fury Road is another one rollercoaster ride you don't want to miss. You don't have to watch the previous films to get more of the overall story but if you like, then do so. Mad Max is legit.",4
  George Miller does it again. What a visual masterpiece with very little CGI and real action stunts.,5
  Best movie I've seen in a long time,5
"  Holy shit this movie is fucking awesome. Best movie of 2015. Although the movie has almost no plot to speak of. The action makes up for it. The CGI and practical blend in magically, and at some points I have trouble telling the difference. This movie was everything I wanted and more. If you haven't seen this movie yet, go see it for fucks sake. Best action movie I have seen in a long time.",5
"  A very pleasant surprise. Better than the original ones, great movie.",4
"  Just another silly, overblown action flick.",2
"  An amazing, perfectly executed journey into Miller's dystopia. A must see for fans of action flicks.",5
  how can u rate this movie so high.,1
"  A high energy, intense, and emotional joyride from start to finish. Mad Max: Fury Road captures everything good about the series while adding a fresh new look and reviving a series that was better than it should have been.",5
"  The simple plot (one long chase scene) is elevated by everything else in the film. The acting is good, the action is intense. I like that it doesn't follow many action film cliches. Spoiler alert! - Max and Furiosa do not end up in a romantic relationship. I am so happy they didn't make them love interest. Although there is a romantic relationship between side characters, its exactly that, a side story and it isn't done over the top.Criticism for this movie having over the top ""CGI"" and being feminist is laughable. Its just a great action film. It passed the wife test.",5
  This movie was awful. It was extremely predictable. The acting was stiff and poor. The over the top effects were too much and were there to distract from the crappy acting and paper thin plot line. How this movie was even nominated for anything other than a razzy is beyond me.,0
"  I'm not going to write this comparing it to the original Mad Max film, I just don't think it's worth while to do so, they're just different movies and casts (get over it!). I WILL say on that note that this movie is as impressive today as the original MM was then... perhaps even more so. This was truly one of the most insane movie going experiences I've ever had. It's like a Burning Man, Cirque de Soliel, inverted Blue Man Group mash-up acid-trip in the best possible sense. Low on story complexity and script but overflowing with art, camp and very intricate, flawlessly executed action sequences. That said, there are some over-the-top moments I could have done without for sure (guitar-guy!?), but there was such attention to detail in almost every single frame that it's almost irresistibly artful in its way. There's just something really impressive here. The performances are very strong considering the restraints of an almost non-existent script, and the action is simply unprecedented in this genre (IMO). The intro scene alone of the film is so good and tight that the theatre actually broke out in a smattering of applause just for that. At the end of the movie all you can do is laugh and applaud in exhaustion, trying to comprehend the unyielding bombastic action and absurdity of what the hell it was you just witnessed. Now you have to keep an open mind that if you only like say Wes Anderson films, or rich scripted little art house films, this is NOT going to be your jam, in fact you're probably going to loath it. But if you're like me and you have room in your world for any well executed art regardless of genre this is just not a movie to be missed. Trust me, it's much more enjoyable than your hollow, run-of-the-mill action movie.",4
  Il film é visivamente notevole peccato si siano persi la sceneggiatura da qualche parte...,2
"  Obviously the Road Warrior is the best Mad Max, but this is right up with it. Action packed and thrilling, one of the best films I have ever seen.",5
  It is the Quintessential action film of this generation.,5
"  Jay's Review of Mad Max: Fury RoadI haven't seen a lot of the mad max films and that's probably why I'm going tobe so negative on this one. So let's start with the story: Max helps a girl save the abused wives of a religious dictator who leads a clan and controls most of the water. Tom Hardy does a pretty good job as Mad Max, but he barely has any dialogue and it kind of annoys me because it sound like a lot happened in between the films and I would've love to see him talk about but not to much. Furiosa is an interesting character, but her rebelling all of a sudden is kinda of a weird introduction to the character. All the other actors do a great job in this film.Now the action, funny a lot people say this is some of the best action in cinema, but it barely goes farther than mission impossible and 007. What I mean is that it's pretty underwhelming and it does that instead of talking about scenes that are never brought up or explored.It has some ok action and it's well acted but it kind of gets boring as it goes on.",2
  Just to say : Phew !,4
"  I'm treating this as a stand-alone movie simply because I have not seen writer/director George Miller's three other films in the franchise. I was surprised that an action film like this received an Oscar Nom for Best Picture and I didn't see this until after the nominations had been announced and a local indie theater scheduled a midnight showing. It has a post apocalyptic car chase plot; it is a fossil-fuels-and-the-fall-of-paradise parable. With Furiosa's character, the other slave girls, and the Keeper of the Seeds there is a healthy dose of feminism injected. But still it is fairly basic story-wise. It is practically chromium steel porn. And yet George Miller and team are masters at getting the blood pumping through non-stop action, which was so fun to watch. I read about the practical stunts and effects. They were impressive. It ended up winning six Oscars including one for editing. The vigorous cuts and unique production designs led to such a thrilling other-worldly experience. Hardy, Theron, Hoult, and Keays-Byrne all commanded the screen. The one thing that was too over-the-top for me was the guitarist in the war party. That guy thrashing his ax with pyrotechnics in a world where fuel is scarce was beyond my threshold of willing suspension of disbelief.",5
  This movie is the most awesome movie to come out this decade.,5
  Creative...not my favorite but fun to watch,2
  Don't watch this movie or you will be in a desprerate need of a sequel,5
"  George Miller showed us a definition of what an ""action movie"" is and what a ""practical work"" is from this film. Not only the film was a feast to the eyes but also a feast to the ears. An action film that will be remembered for a long time",5
"  Whoa, what a ride! That was the most adrenaline pumping film experience I've had in a long time. The whole story can be described in one sentence but the action is so beautifully made that it feels almost like one long choreographed dance. Ups the ante for all subsequent movies that wants to include any kind of chase scene involving vehicles. This I will most definitely see again. And I am almost tempted to actually see the earlier films in this franchise...",4
"  This was amazing, a two-hour chase movie with a feminist messege and nothing but action. Mad Max is back. Best movie of 2015 so far, by far.",4
  Absolute garbage. There is absolute zero value to a movie that has nothing more to it than driving around and explosions.,0
  Best action film ever made.,4
"  Wow, I don''t get all the hype. Really didn't like this movie.",2
  Excellent job of bringing back an old iconic movie back,4
"  This film will clean house come Oscar season, GUARANTEED.",4
"  One of the most overrated films on RT and certainly the most overrated in 2015. I was looking forward to this film simply due to positive ratings and my appreciation for the Mad Max franchise. It was truly shocking to see this overrated film was. It reinforced my disappointment in how this industry nurtures a group-think mentality amongst its ""professional"" critics. However, I can understand the general public's group-think adulation of this action film.The female heroine (or ""you go-girl"") trend in Hollywood is taken to its extreme in this film, almost similar to ""300: Rise Of An Empire"" (2014). It was so intentional that the rest of the plot-line was lost on me as it seemed this was simply a feminist flick to endorse strong female lead characters.There were excellently produced action scenes, things being blown up, to satisfy those members of the viewing public that paid good money to watch such things. However, this was not a work of art. The original Mad Max was original.",2
"  Once of the best action movies I've seen, the directing in this film is so amazing and George Miller should have won an Academy Award for it. Although the brutal and aggressive action overshadows everything, there is actually well meaningful themes in this film beyond all the wildness and monstrosity. Seriously this is what action movies are all about, the exhilaration, the visuals it's feels too perfect. Tom Hardy and Charlie Theron both deliver top notch performances. This is every action movie lovers dream.",4
  Non-stop madness. Miller takes you on a road trip through hell and you will like it.,4
"  Arguably the best movie of 2015 to me(some others surprisingly like The Force Awakens more), this movie is on par with the classic that is Mad Max 2:Road Warrior. This movie looks spectacular(I believe it took 25 or 15 years to make),casting choices like Tom Hardy was a excellent pick, the action is non stop(in a good way like The Bourne Ultimatum), and the dialogue is rough. I have NO FLAWS on this movie!Find this on DVD now!",5
"  'Mad Max' is mostly a long, dull chase, i'm shocked that most of the top critics found this any good. Sure the special effects are overwhelming, but it lacked in the plot, acting, dialogue, and originality.",2
"  I'm not going to lie... I was only half watching this. There was just so much going on. Honestly I already knew I wouldn't invest too much into this movie because I lowkey hate playing chaotic video games like this. I am more of a ratchet and clank, organized chaos kind of gal. That being said, this films chaos was nothing short of brilliant. It brought you into this zaney world and kept you there the entire time. Ultimately, I understand the films positive raining but it was not my cup of tea.",2
"  It's a great action movie, Tom Hardy takes really good the roll of Max.",5
  A study in minimalism. Simple and fantastic.,5
"  - I've seen this 3 times now, one of the best action films of the last decade, perhaps of all-time. The look of the film is gorgeous, and great performances from Hardy and Theron. The film is essentially one long heart-pumping action scene. A must watch!- Watched this a 2nd time and loved it again. Best action film this year easily. beautifully shot, loads of action, and strong performances. This one is a must watch!",4
"  Daring, kinetic and Mad. this film is technically glorious and it rattles on at a killer pace. Inventive and smart which for a road based action movie is utterly refreshing.",5
"  Pure action, in the good way. And by the way it's directed by the same guy as the other films so that's a plus.",5
"  I get it. Mad Max is supposed to be a crazy insane post apocalyptic movie, but I still don't see how it's frenetic editing, over the top stunt work, freaky philosophical premise warranted six oscars.",1
"  Lots of road action and effects. Very entertaining if you like that sort of thing. Needed more plot, character/relations development and more situations not involving road battles. But is called Road Warrior. I'd say try it out.",2
  Garbage that lacks the originality of the original. The only thing that makes it halfway decent is how pretty the explosions are. The plot is has serious gaps in it and the heroes don't differentiate themselves from the side characters. If you liked the original you might enjoy this film but I will guarantee that you won't watch it more than once.,2
"  Finally! An update/rehash that is completely worthy of the original! Honestly one of the best ""action"" films I have ever seen. It's completley beautiful and the acting is MUCH stronger than the best this genre usually has to offer. Outstanding.If you have been skipping this out of fear/love of the 80's films, see it immediately. You won't be disappointed.",4
"  I didn't like this movie. There was hardly any talking and the characters were just exaggerated toughguys (didn't matter whether they were male a female). I couldn't wait for it to end. Unfortunately, I had to wait A LONG time for it to end.",1
  a true action masterpiece,5
"  Such an overrated movie. The action becomes tiresome and boring after half an hour, there's little to no plot and I did not make one emotional connection to any of the characters. It was a snooze-fest.",1
"  I was one of the many that has never seen a Mad Max film, so I wasn't expecting much. I was blown away in that regard! Max Max is insanity on the silver screen; chaotic when there is action going on and surprisingly quiet and peaceful in lulls. The pacing is excellent.Tom Hardy plays Max, a man of little words but many actions. He was captured by Imperator Joe and his War boys, and enslaved to them, forced to give his blood to keep the sick war boys alive and make them stronger.While Hardy is the leading name, I feel that the two best performances were actually by Charlize Theron as the fierce Imperator Furiosa and Nicholas Hoult as Nux, the endearingly reverent War boy. Despite the performances, Miller's vision is by far what makes the film a rousing success.Mad Max is white-knuckle excitement at its highest octane, and I would be hard pressed to deny that I had so much fun watching it.",5
  I recommend watching how they made this film first... It will make you appreciate this work of art so much more when you watch it.,4
  I did not see the other films and this is the worst movie of 2015 in my opinion.,1
  Furiosa is the star.,4
  Best imagery on the big screen in years. Splendid dystopia!!!!!,5
  Had to update this after many more viewings. Probably the best action movie I've ever seen. And that is coming from a person that has T2 in his top 5 of all time.,4
"  A rare case of excessive action, minimal story and shallow characters that really works. A unique movie experience.",4
  Pretty wicked action movie. George Miller does it again after so many years on from the original. Theron and Hardy were great together.,4
"  Beautiful movie, but just not very interesting. It was boring and didn't bring anything new to the genre. Filming location was beautiful, though.",2
  Worthless movie. Not a worthy sequal.,1
"  I'm going to be honest, I thought this movie was going to be absolutely crap, I thought it was going to fall short considering how much of a masterpiece the original is, I was truly so surprised. For a movie that was just racing and jumping, this movie was absolutely amazing, and I think I may have liked it better than the original. (Which is one of my favorite movies of all time)",5
  Best Movie of the year.,5
  A MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
"  THIS. This is an action movie. I hate action movies because the stories are often vapid. The story in Mad Max: Fury Road is meaningful, It's powerful. And it's matched only by the stunning cinematography. This movie is gorgeously shot and perfectly edited. Every action scene is natural. It isn't forced, even if there are some very choreographed scenes. It works. And considering the movement of the vehicles as these shots take place, it feels real. I'm sure there are some effects used, but the scale is epic and reminds me of the intensity of the chariot races in ""Ben-Hur."" Simply said, this movie is brilliant.",5
"  Great cinematography, fast cut editing, non-stop action, an amazing score,? intense sequences and an outstanding performance of a badass female character. It definitely is a mad world. What else can I ask?",5
"  This is far and away the most over-rated movie made in the last 20 years. I dare anyone to go back and watch the original Mad Max, then watch this steaming heap of garbage and tell me again that this is the ""second best science fiction movie of ALL TIME"". You children have lost your minds.",1
"  A simply outstanding (as well as outstandingly simple) post-apocalyptic, dystopian, punk, Western, car chase action film. Director George Miller said that he aspired to Hitchcock's ideal of a film that a person in Japan could watch, enjoy, and understand without reading any subtitles. And Miller has damn well succeeded. If I have one complaint, it's that not enough time was spent on the slave women: their sleeping arrangements, their bathing rituals, their unblemished bodies. What is sex like in the world of Mad Max? Specifically, group sex? I guess we'll never know. Le sigh.Srsly, though: bravo, George Miller. Take a bow.",5
  Stunning movie with amazing visuals and brilliant non-stop car action.,4
  Good movie. Weird af,0
"  I understand why this movie has the hype that it does, but I really don't like it. It's so... boring. It really is just a feature length chase scene, and it's boring.",2
"  mad max: fury road is probably one of the best action films since the raid. don't forget I said one, there's still john wick. fury road may be light on story, but when it comes to action sequences and the lack of CGI and green or blue screen, it's a masterpiece. fury road is filled with practical effects along with amazing stuntwork.Owens grade: A",4
  There is hope in this post-apocalyptic world.,5
  Best action film of all time. And the black and white directors release is brilliant and gives the film a completely different feel.,5
  Tom Hardy sucks the joy out of this movie,0
  I've seen this movie so many fucking times,5
"  I won't talk about the visuals of the movie. Although dazzling and much written about, no visuals could possibly eclipse the powerful ideas it has to offer. And this is exactly the part that many critics seem to neglect for some bizarre reason.On the one hand we have the world of men: infused with phony ideology, drunk on fake glory, and built for the sole purpose of feeding into power of a single man at the top. The rusty hierarchy is squeezing out just enough juice to keep the masses eke out an existence, but always wanting for more. The only exception is Mad Max, who, although an outsider, has also given up on hope.On the other, we have Furiosa in the midst of a rebellious act, fleeing this pathetic existence with the few drops of purity it birthed, toward a Green Place. Through methodical hard work, she came to possess just enough trust and power to escape - for redemption, she said, but we learn soon after that she needed hope more than anything and anyone.The attention to detail is astounding. In the action movie, which would normally just settle for a lot of CGI and loud sounds (and which MMFR has plenty of), the details are so abundant that they seem almost gratuitous: the school yard lingo you'd expect from a gang that maybe got stranded and grew up on an island and knows no one but each other; the unusual arsenal of tricks and weaponry suited for road wars; the war drums and flame-throwing electrical guitars that fulfill the role of military marches, yet much more shrill and insane; the skeletal arm drawing on the side of the rig. These couldn't have possibly be fashioned by anyone other than someone absolutely obsessed with that violent and grotesque world, someone who lived there for decades, and who survived to tell the tale. That's why this world, like a powerful magnet, clicks into place so naturally, into a hole that was apparently there - no lengthy explanations are needed, because the darkness it exposes lives in all of us.At one point, I felt the anger so boundless I couldn't contain myself; it just exited in a shriek and left me shaken to my core for the remainder of their journey. I hesitate to call this an 'episode' of a 'film' for fear that it would diminish what it stirred. It is belief in justice, in freedom, in peace that is defiled and trampled upon if we only give in to the darker demons of our nature - if what rules instead are greed, bigotry, and violence.What really got imprinted into my brain were the Many Mothers. The old women with dry chuckles and winks and smiles were the most reassuring, the most human sight of the entire spectacle. We need these women in our lives: those who don't listen to the war cries and war horns, but believe in their own righteousness and purity. Given the chance, they will create and grow and nurture, but they will fight with all their strength to preserve what's right when the have to. If only men were not so caught up on their greed, lust, and war games, we might have had a better, kinder world. If we trust our better nature, we just might, eventually.",5
"  Plot, Production Design, Action, Cast all are Amazing about this Movie...!!!",5
"  Al entrar a la sala de cine a ver esta pelicula tenia miedo de encontrarme con un remake que me hiciera sentir enojo, pero no fue asi, esta es una de las mejores peliculas de accion y aventura del 2015, nada que envidiarle a las antiguas peliculas, accion pura y respeto total por la vision post apocaliptica que inspiro las peliculas de los 70's, grandes roles principales con Hardy y Theron, accion de principio a fin.",4
  Hands down the greatest action movie ever made.,5
"  Wow again has just the back to real life feel that movies have been losing thanks Mr,Miller for your art form!!!",4
  A rare movie I can watch over and over for days and days,5
"  As a guy who wasn't a huge fan of the Mad Max franchise, I had low expectations for this. That being said... I was blown away. Miller took me completely by surprise and gave me one of the best action movies I've ever seen.",5
  Solid actioner with stunning visuals. Best picture candidate? Not on your nelly.,4
"  Even for viewers unfamiliar with this series, Mad Max thrusts us into a beautiful post-apocalyptic world that awes us through start to finish. Amazing colors, action sequences, and brutality throughout, Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron play off each other brilliantly even though they are silent for large portions of the movie. None the less, they add to the originality of the films action and story and with the help of a talented cast, Fury Road earns it's mark as one of the greatest films of the 21st century.",5
"  Mad Max Fury Road is George Miller's return to the franchise he started way back in 1979 with Mad Max. I will start by saying this movie was absolutely batsh** insane. It was filled right to the brim with continuous over the top bloody ridiculous action sequences that keep you on the edge of the seat and just amazed at what Is happening on screen. Now this film doesn't have much of a plot at all but seriously you're not going into this film for an intense plot, this is a film that almost didn't even need one at all. The one thing I was worried about going in was whether I needed to have seen the previous films to understand this one and thankfully you don't, the story is independent of the previous film which was really helpful. The characters were all awesome and it did an amazing job to introduce them all almost instantly and get right into the action. Max (Tom Hardy? and Furiosa (Charlize Theron) were were great and extremely likable characters. Even the villain who I will just call Sweet Tooth was so great, he wasn't anything too special but was a great threat throughout the film. I just absolutely loved this movie, intense action from start to finish and didn't slow down at all, that made it ridiculously fun to watch. The great characters and the performances are awesome on screen and we're always interesting to watch. If there was ever a Twisted Metal movie, this is what it would be. Nothing really let the film down and everything really worked, such a great time and the best cinema experience",5
"  This is one hell of a ride, and I enjoyed every moment of it! A simple story with traditional stunts and effects, including memorable characters! George Miller is the badass director whom we love! Awesome job!",4
"  One of those rare films that gets better with each viewing, Deceptively smart and progressive wrapped in a heart pounding chase.",5
  Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant!,5
"  This movie is INCREDIBLE!! One of my favorite action movies period, up there with Die Hard and the first two Terminator movies. It is absolutely insane, loaded with amazing action sequences, and surprisingly a well developed between the main characters. This is a must-see and the best film of 2015, I love it more than Inside Out, Spotlight, and Star Wars: The Force Awakens, I am dead serious.",5
  A Masterpiece. A filmmaking course.,5
"  Not a big fan of mindless action flicks, but this film was amazing and glad I gave it a look",4
"  I thought this was better than the originals, even though I loved the originals as well.",5
"  I waited to watch this movie for a while and I'm honestly sad I wasted any time waiting. The movie was awful, the worst I've seen in a long time, the plot was predictable and the action scenes were unbelievable in nature. Overall 0/5 wish I could get my time back.",0
  exceptional production. makes you remember that movie making is art. I love the ending,5
"  My Great-Grandfather used to say ""it takes little to amuse the simple"". His point is exemplified in the overwhelming fandom of this tragically underwhelming live-action cartoon. Wholly lacking any character, no real story to be acted out and more CGI than a handful of Michael Bay movies combined. I can only assume that fans of this flick that claim to be fans of the original truly only woke up to see the ""kid with the boomerang"" and the ""crazy dude in the gyro-copter"" after drinking themselves to a stupor during the movie itself.",0
  What a pointless piece of shit. How can people like this shit like come on,1
"  Exhilarating, tons of fun, and batshit crazy! Mad Mad Fury Road is pure action gold with exceptional camerawork, practical effects and very limited use of CGI.",5
"  Just loved it to the bone. It's a piece of art, a cinema lesson and a directorial resurrection. Makes you love movies!",4
"  A horribly basic theme, with stereotypic characters and a predictable story. Probably the worst movie I've seen this year.",1
"  Awesome 3D, like, really amazing. Sound was noteworthy & loud. Charlize & Tom Hardy were so stoically badass as well. All the really weird costuming & violence is really not my thing, but I can appreciate how well it was done.",4
  That was a pretty wild movie...,5
  Good Lord... what the hell just happened?!?!?!,5
"  Thanks to its flawless direction, breathtaking sequences and thought provoking themes and imagery, Mad Max: Fury Road will be remembered as one of the best action films of all time.",5
"  If you want a movie that will grow on you more and more every time you watch it, this is a really good example. The action goes by you at such a pace that you must watch it multiple times to really catch everything. It's a lot to take in and process the first time around. This is truly a classic for the future and I have a feeling it's going to be one of the greatest movies to come from this decade.",5
  went to see it with high excpections it was great but a very very weak plot,4
"  Should have been called ""Mad Max: Furiosa!"" She is more the center of attention than Max in this movie. Since I adore post-apocalyptic themes, I did very much enjoy this movie. At one point, though, I did almost fall out of the movie seat, laughing. The scene is serious and intense...and then, in comes the heavy metal guitarist. Rofl. You'll understand if you watch the movie.",4
"  Through a mix of magnificent visual effects, astonishing action sequences, and memorable characters, Mad Max: Fury Road gives us one of the best action films of all time.",5
"  Honestly don't understand what was good about this movie. The story line was absolutely, rocks in the head, dumb, on top of that the pictures made to bring that story line to life on the screen were made even worse by the director. I can't waste any more time on this.",0
"  96%Mad Max: Fury Road is a bizarre and expertly crafted film, boasting amazing stunts and fast-paced, oil-fueled action sequences built for maximum entertainment.V: 85%",5
"  A heart-pounding, full throttle action spectacle, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a powerhouse of a survival story.",4
"  Back in 1981 The Road Warrior rewrote the formula for action films, and now in 2015 Fury Road rewrites the formula for films altogether. This insane 120 minute ride of pure adrenaline is about as close to perfection as there is. The greatest 80's action film to not come out of the 80's.",5
"  97% George Miller's post- apocalyptic franchise successfully comes back to glorious life with amazing detail to action and continuity, making Mad Max: Fury Road the action film we've all been waiting for.",5
"  While the visuals were amazing, and the story was decent, neither were enough to overcome the constant onslaught of action. Too many times, I found myself looking at my watch to see how much time had elapsed only to see no time at all had passed. If you do not mind a 2 hour car chase, watch it, enjoy. But for my money, this was time wasted.",2
"  Now having never seen the original Mad Max films I wasn't sure what to expect with this but really enjoyed this film. The cast was fantastic, the stunts were incredible and the story was gripping.",4
"  I have never been a fan of post-apocalyptic films, but Fury Road's characters and cinematography were enough to keep me interested and its plot and acting also were pluses. Overall the only aspect that kept me from rating this film higher is the ridiculous stunts and at times cheesy attempts to appeal to the younger generation.",2
  Few movies have I enjoyed as much as this one.,5
"  Incredibly fun to watch with amazing visuals. If the story was a little bit more understandable, this would've been the perfect summer action movie.",4
  I was skeptical about Fury Road but it's now my favorite action film. It's a perfect action flick with a lot on its mind.,5
"  This movie is action poetry. Just finished, want to watch it again. Damn good flick!",4
  Found the premise of movie to be dull and 1 dimensional.Found it impossible to connect with the characters. Started yawning about half way through. Thumbs down??,0
"  Mad Max: Fury Road is probably the best action movie of the decade and is one of the best action movies of all time. The action is exciting, the acting is great, especially Charlize Theron, the story isn't very deep but is a good story for an action movie and is a great return to form for George Miller.",5
"  One of the best movies that I have seen in a long time. It's essentially one big long chase sequence filled with practical effects and George Miller's strange-yet-intriguing style. I was interested in the movie from start to finish, and it was a refreshing break from all the cheese and corny Transformers-esque garbage that we usually see in movies these days.",5
"  Not impressed. I struggled to find the tie in to the original movies, which I liked. I cannot tell if this is a sequel, a prequel, or a remake.",2
  Masterpiece! not a remake -thank god!- just a high octane roller coaster full of thrills!!!,5
  Really good movie. Would have been better with a little more dialogue and a little less grunting from Max.,4
"  One of the best action movies ever! Brilliantly acted, visually impressive and overloaded with awesome action stunts and special effects",5
"  Great acting. Amazing action. SPECTACULAR practical effects. While it may seem like it's short on plot,it just shows you what and how it is so you can connect the dots. A revitalization of a long dead franchise,can't wait for the sequel!",4
"  What am I watching? This should have been titled Furiosa: Fury Road with a cameo from Mad Max. I heard this was great because of the non-stop, brain dead action, which it has. But sadly, this is a severe departure from the first three. Max isn't ""Mad"" insane, he's ""Mad"" angry, as evident by the originals. I'm sure the franchise train will keep rolling and force another sequel down our throats, and there will be plenty to gobble it up.",0
"  George Miller proves that age is not a factor, as he returns to the franchise he created, with the best installment yet. Charlize Theron takes us (and Tom Hardy) on a non-stop action thrill-ride that leaves viewers begging for another installment. While the plot is virtually non-existent, Fury Road more than makes up for it with strong characters and an amazing visuals, If you haven't seen Fury Road, you're missing out on the best movie of 2015!",5
  Senseless computerized action; a waste of time.,1
  The only bad thing about it is that it doesn't end quite as brilliant as it begins.,4
  Everybody is saying that it is one of the best action movies ever and they are right.,5
"  Really wierd, but really really good! An absolute joy to watch every second is exhilarating, possibly the best car chases ever. A use of effects that adds to the film instead of distracting from whats happening. Masterpiece, a film i wont easily forget.",5
  It's extraordinary. I love the first scense of this movie.This movie had great start and diffent end.,5
"  I was hugely disappointed. Worst film I've seen for years.Firstly, it's not a Mad Max film. The character that's supposed to be Max does not have Max's personality and does not seem to have Max's past either. (Max did not have a daughter) There is no attempt to link the events in the previous films to this one.That does not necessarily make it a bad film in its own right though. Complete lack of plot, characterisation and realism do that. I didn't find my self caring about any of the characters. They just seem to be mindless automatons. Max was always fairly stoic and terse in the old films, but in this one he barely says a word. The action is relentless and there are no breaks to discover anything about any of the characters.The film also suffers from inconsistent tone. Lurching from cartoony violence on one hand, to serious issues like slavery on the other. It feels rather like Waterworld in this regard.The film was widely praised for its feminism, which I find bizarre. There is nothing feminist about this film. Yes, the protagonist is female, but she acts like a man. The message is basically: To be strong, woman has to become a man. Contrast this with a genuine female action character like Ellen Ripley from Alien: The Ripley character could not have been played by a man.The other female characters are in two groups: The antagonist's harem - five beautiful, helpless waifs who need rescuing; and the Vuvalini tribe. The Vuvalini tribe are at least somewhat more interesting. Middle-aged women rarely appear in action roles. However, they are almost all killed off as cannon fodder without really leaving any impression.The first two Mad Max films had a gritty realism to them. Their setting was just about plausible and the plot was completely believable. Beyond Thunderdome lost a bit of this, but Fury Road does away with it completely and goes pure comic-book. Everyone's a hero, wounds are shrugged off, guns have infinite ammo. Some people obviously like this style but for me it just makes it boring.There are some good points: The film is beautiful. Some of the action sequences are very good.",0
"  Mad Max: Fury Road becomes so far one of the best films of the year. It unleashes MAD imagination, talented actors and eye-popping effects by storm!",4
  Intense. None-Stop Thriller Action ! underwhelming performance by Tom Hardy however - more like Mad Furiosa: Furry Road,4
"  Lively, Vibrant and Exuberant, Mad Max: Fury Road is a must-watch, as it delivers with superb, flamboyant action, lives up to the hype, and is a blockbuster success",4
  Fantastic. Charlize is superb.,4
"  Great visuals, and you can really get absorbed into the post-apocalyptic world. But, the story is very simplistic and undesirable.",4
"  Mad Max is exhilarating, intense moments, enough narrative heft, great performance, great customes, and the action were fantastic. Although I haven't seen the original Mad Max, but this reboot/sequel was grreat. George Miller brought the post-apocalyptic franchise back to life!",4
"  One of the best theater experiences I've ever had, even despite going to a gross, rundown $2 theater where at one point the exit door flung open during a thunderstorm. That's how engrossing the film was.",4
"  First, the positives. Theron and Hardy were magnificient and was rightly cast for this movie. The stunts were amazing as well as the CGI. Not a dull moment really, the movie kept a good pace and 2 hrs flew by.Now, those are what makes this bearable, if you can get past the ridiculous story, ridiculous premise, etc... To be honest? Perhaps it is a cultural thing. As an Asian, I just can't seem to understand why would anyone think up of such a ridiculous post-apocalyptic future. Perhaps this is what happens to white men when the world goes awry.EDIT: I changed this from 2 stars to 4.5 after watching it a couple more times. I think it really is about getting past the premise. This is not meant to be a serious film, just an action packed science fiction. Also, reading up on more of the pre-stories helped understand a lot of misconceptions in the film.",4
  This movie was not what I expected it is very hard to look at because it's very predictable and filmmakers should not be seen during scenes not necessarily an edge of your seat film,1
  this movie is two hours of feminist propaganda. such a disappointment,0
"  Okay. Sit down, buckle up and enjoy the ride. This film has everything for action fans. George Miller delivers stunning imagery, and a cleverly interesting plot. The main characters deliver with believable performances. The action sequences which are many, are jaw dropping and get your heart pumping. This is the best all around action film in many years...IMHO.",4
  I have never wanted a movie to not end so badly in my entire life.,5
  One of the greatest action movie ever made,5
  One of the best action movies ever.,5
  Insane action movie!,0
  Awesome... just wish there was more. And Max's character should have had more lines.,4
"  I'm at a loss to explain what movie the rest of the world is seeing. Halfway through this film I turned to my wife and said ""surely this is almost over?"" Then it proceeded to go all the way back to the beginning in reverse. Not certain this can even be called a movie. A movie has a theme. A plot. A story. Characterization. This has incredible car mashups that explode beautifully. That's a sequence of scenes, not a movie.",0
  Awesome! Loved the action! Loved the car chases! Camera work made me a little dizzy but who cares really! I recommend this to action movie fans!,5
"  What I thought would be a crappy movie, actually turned out to be one of the year's best movies.",4
  This movie was entertaining from start to finish. Couldn't believe it really. I I'm not the biggest fan of action movies but it's probably going to develop a cult-like following. Deserving.,5
"  Few films get 5 stars. This one does. Near flawless. That said, it must be stated that this movie is a blantant and total ripoff of the Original Star Wars trilogy.",5
  the one star is for the visuals which wear nice eye candy. But the dialog and story was so bad I literally had to force myself to watch the movie all the way. but I had to do that in several sessions. if you turn the sound off maybe it would be a better movie.,1
  Outstanding movie. Everything about this is perfection.,5
  Pros:Visually appealingActionArtistic Cons:Barely any plot On and off bad acting Uninteresting Not as good as the originals,2
"  Mad Max: Fury Road was sheer madness that isn't sullied with horrendous acting or dull dialogue. It's a damn blockbuster that is intense and doesn't have a sense of humor that could equated to a fluffy kitten. It's George Miller's attempt to reignite his long dormant Mad Max franchise... and my god does he ever. He single handedly delivers our saving grace in the genre of action with a blind zombie playing a fire breathing electric guitar on the back of an oil rig. If you don't love that, than why do you watch action films?",4
  Brilliant movie! I can't wait to see the next one!,4
  I made me felt awake all the story go.,5
"  I'm not sure if I should've seen the other Mad Max movies to really understand what was going on - all that being said, I had no idea what the actually story line was but I didn't care cause there was so much awesome action and amazing visuals that I could've cared less about the what the actual story was about. This coming from a guy who really enjoys great storylines and not much action in the films he watches. I'll probably have to watch it a few more times to understand what was really going on there.",4
  Stupid movie. No plot.,0
"  How can this fucken piece of crap shit movie get 97% it is utterly one of the most boring movies of all time. No character development no cities, vilains are jokes guys plays guitar some random scenes that makes no sense just a barren waste land and cars chasing. And that gets a better review then Fucking Inception, Batman the dark knight Lord of the ring etc like wth it's shit that gets clogged in your toilet.",1
  One of the best movies I've seen,5
  best movie of the year so far,5
"  One of the best films of 2015,but he has a story like another more it change history in the middle of the film",4
"  Really had no idea what to expect when I went to see this. I walked out of the theatre shaking and grinning ear to ear, and saying ""that...was amazing!"" Yes, I'm a fan of the old ones, but this certainly took it to another level of excitement. Everything about it was so good, and I appreciate the minimization of the script. Not much really needed to be said, and any more lines might have ruined it.",5
"  No story. Great action, that's about it.",2
  The Best Action Film! Exhilarating from Start to Finish. All around great performance from Charlize Theron.',5
"  There Are Times When A Film Is So Engrossing and Immersive, Not Just With Visual Flair, But With Raw Perfect Talent Given By Both The Actors And Crew, You Have No Choice But To Say: ""Holy S#$T"". That's Exactly What I Did At The End Of This Film.10 / 10 Yes Its Effects Driven, But Includes An Amazingly Emotional Storyline and Atmosphere.",5
  unlike anything else ever!,5
"  An Action film for the Ages, Mad Max Fury Road has breathtaking visuals, one of the all time best soundtracks, awesome heroes, and a surprising amount of narrative and emotional heft. its flaws, though prevalent (pacing is an issue in the first half, and the villain could have been better), it such an experience that they all take a back seat. while i have yet to determine if its better than Kingsman: The Secret Service (another awesometacular action film) Mad Max 4 is definitely the best film of this year (tied with Kingsman). See it Big. See It Loud.",5
"  Mad Max is a rare movie. The script isn't that complex or creative or ingenious. The performances and the direction on the other hand are so masterfully executed that you hardly note the (sometimes dumb) plotholes. Charlize Theron proves again that her great performances do not rely on her beauty but on her great talent, she is the real star of the movie and frankly carries a Tom Hardy who hardly just appears and groans (not that his character demand much more). Overall, the movie is great in the sense that you can feel how George Miller cares about this franchise, this baby of his that he so carefuly organized and turned into one of the best action/sci-fi movies of the last decades.",4
"  Mad Max: Fury Road is a master of action. We wondered if Miller would ever top the Road Warrior and our answer was yes. Exhilarating, fun, beautiful and a surprising amount of character depth was found in the simple premise of Fury Road.",5
"  Loved this from beginning to end! Action, action, action!",5
"  This is going to be the action film with an action-packed plot that is going to be remembered for decades. I loved this movie, and it really is one of the best action movies I have seen in a while and is easily a contender for one of the best movies of the year.",5
"  One of my favourite movies of all time. If George Miller doesn't direct the sequels I will be disappointed with Hollywood. One of the most beautifully shot action movies, maybe even movies ever. I love this film and can't wait to watch it several more times. Avengers 2 doesn't deserve a billion dollars... But this most certainly does.Update: I ended up watching it three more times in the cinemas...",5
  the entire movie is a car chase,5
  Somehow a film exists which can appeal equally to people who appreciate Dune and The Fast and the Furious.,4
"  Wasted hours of my life I won't get back. Not sure how anyone could have liked this film. Garbage after garbage, not a compelling story. Sucked",0
  Puts Michael Bay to SHAME!!!!,5
"  While this post-apocalyptic thrill ride will definitely not suit everybody, Mad Max: Fury Road pumps an extraordinary amount of energy into the concept, in the form of great acting, exhilarating action and some surprising narrative heft. Not for the faint hearted or those wanting a relaxing movie.Verdict: A-",4
  It has everything a Mad Max movie should have...times ten. A roller coaster of non-stop action sequences left me out of breath.,4
  Here's one of those movies when the lead character had been overshadowed by a supporting character due to acting. Charlize Theron as Furiosa was more compelling. It is also empowering for women and person's with disabilities to see her character come to life.,5
  This is one of the best movie i have ever see,5
  it was great fun. excited beautifully. great addition to the Mad Max franchise.,4
  Filming was amazing. Editing was amazing. Characters were amazing. Strong feminist message and environmentalism. Only criticism is that it didn't go on for longer.,5
  Another movie that is good. Not worth a 97%...but good.,4
  Anyone else think the actress in this looks like Furiosa?,0
"  Horrible! it is just a 2 hours persecution with an excess of unnecessary violence, the story is just as bad as the crazy and ugly characters.",0
  AWESOME!!!!!!! PERFECT!!!!!!!! LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
"  Después de una de las trilogías más icónicas e importantes en la acción, llega esta película que redefinirá el término de locura.Llega a un nivel destructivo que sus predecesoras no habían podido alcanzar donde todo es brillante y desquiciado: los escenarios todo áridos e infértiles, la música frenética e inverosímil, los vestuarios, los vehículos bien marcados en el diseño de producción donde todo es tan creativo y asombroso que atrapa en ese mundo excelentemente realizado.La mente maestra de George Miller explota su calidad haciendo este trabajo tan hermoso explotando al máximo su capacidad y donde vuelven las persecuciones automovilísticas tan bien hechas que son innovadoras y brillantes, y es acción bien hecha, con sentido propio y donde todo impacta manteniendo una tensión latente.El mundo tiene aquí la nueva definición de locura en todo su máximo esplendor.Las actuaciones son sorprendentes con Tom Hardy haciendo honor al personaje y Charlize Theron dando fuerza a la película. Inmortal Joe es un grandioso villano y Nux (Nicholas Hoult) representa todo lo que simboliza esta película, la cual esta llena de frases increibles y brillantes de estos mismos.MAD MAX: FURY ROAD (2015) ""Es de las mejores películas de acción de los últimos años. Es en todo sentido brillante, una obra de arte explosiva y desquiciada que es un espectáculo visual de los grandes""",5
"  Mad Movie. Totally different from the series. It was so fascinating, I couldn't take my eyes off as soon as the movie begins. strongly recommend to watch.",5
  George millers reboot of the beloved franchise hits the mark in every way. The action is incredible filmed and executed and what makes it even more impressive is that it was mostly practical effects with barely any CGI. The cast give amazing performances with everybody doing incredible well the stand out had to be Charlize Theron who is incredible as furiosa. It is filmed amazingly and even though the plot isn't the best in the world it is still a very fun action film.,5
"  Fury Road is the rare movie that wastes nothing. Not a character, not a crazy vehicle, not a scene, not a single action is this film is done for no reason. Everything is put to absolute perfect use, as we watch amazing practical action play out in a visually cohesive way. But Miller doesn't let the audience get tired, he throws in scenes of tension, character, and emotional weight to round out the glorious apocalyptic spectacle. After watching it three times in three days, I loved it even more the last time.",4
"  Almost 24 hours after I saw Mad Max: Fury Road and I think the adrenaline is still pumping through my veins. A thrilling two-hour ride through George Miller's post-apocalyptic wasteland, Fury Road is the best movie 2015 has seen so far.I will not lie, being a fan of Mad Max and The Road Warrior, Miller's first two stories following Max Rockatansky in his world, I was skeptical when I heard there would be a fourth movie (I have avoided watching Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, full disclosure). Upon hearing it was Miller who would be at the helm again, it put my mind at ease. My expectations were fully set when I found out the superb Tom Hardy (Inception, The Dark Knight Rises, Bronson) would be playing the titular role.The film begins at breakneck speed and continues at that pace right up to the very end - with maybe a ten minute break in the middle which allows the audience to catch their breath and ease back into their seats. Within the first three minutes, we have our first flipped car - Max's - and he is captured by minions of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played the villain Toecutter in the original Mad Max - a nice homage to the past by Miller), a dictatorial warlord who seems to have complete control over the population of the Capital, hewn into the rock in the wasteland desert. The ensuing chase scene when Max attempts a daring escape from the Capital sets the pace for the rest of the film, as Max races through the tunnels, jumping over cars, jumping out of the structures onto crane hooks...keeping in mind that 80% of the film's stunts were real action and not CGI, this is a pretty cool chase but not even the film's finest. The chase that is the next hour and fifty minutes is even better.Among the populous of the Capital are Nux (Nicolas Hoult, X-Men: First Class), and Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron, Monster), two very different characters. Nux, one of Joe's ""war boys"" is a sickly lad whose only two real friends are growths in his shoulder which he has tattooed smiley faces on (this should give you a sense of the common person in Joe's forces). His ultimate goal is the same as the other war boys, to bring back the escaped fugitives, achieve Joe's recognition and upon death arrive at ""Valhalla.""Furiosa has committed the crime of stealing Joe's wives, five beautiful girls who he has been breeding with in order to try and further his population. Driving a war-rig filled with gasoline, a valuable item in this world, Furiosa sets out with the wives to try and find a new home free of Joe's terror.Max is pulled into all of this by virtue of being a universal blood donor, and spends a good portion of time with an iron mask over his face attached to the front of Nux's car. Hardy proves his acting chops here, as he did in 2012's The Dark Knight Rises, by acting with only his eyes as he reacts to the gunfire, explosions and wild stunts occurring around him as his car speeds through the desert.The rest of the film is essentially a long car chase that left me breathless at several points. Miller's penchant for dramatic stunts is accompanied by strong performances by Hardy and Theron, while Hoult provides a craziness to Nux that offsets the calmess of Max. A man of many words, Max doesn't speak until nearly half an hour into the film, and while he speaks more than he does in The Road Warrior, he never delves into lengthy explanations. His longest lines are delivered with hesitancy and many pauses, reflecting his lack of conversations over the years.Theron's Furiosa essentially becomes the film's true hero, since Max is viewed as an antihero in many ways. Furiosa is a woman of determination who still has hope for a better place that, as Max reminds her, may not exist. This sense of optimism is not as present in Miller's other Max films, but Theron captures it without being carried away by it, and when she realizes it is not to be, she switches back seamlessly into her goal-oriented self who is just trying to keep the wives alive.A spine-pounding score by Junkie XL accents the action which goes on on the screen, making it an action movie opera of sorts, which the majority of the action taking place in car chases, as is the common theme among all Mad Max films. Miller has said in interviews that the whole script was actually written and presented in storyboard form, allowing the action to be fully fleshed out to the best it possibly can be. Filled with homages and references to the first set of Mad Max films, it also works well as a stand-alone film, so those who haven't seen the originals don't have to feel the need to prior to seeing this (I would recommend them though).After seeing Fury Road, it's almost hard to believe Miller is the same mastermind behind the two Happy Feet films, but easy to remember that he created this world that Max inhabits; ""My world is fire and blood,"" proclaims Max in the opening voiceover, and he is 100% right. The action is fast, but unlike some recent action films, the action never seems too fast. The cuts and shots are quick enough to reflect the high tension and action, but not so quick as to have the audience lose their bearings or fall behind in confusion.While spectacular acting might not be required in such a visually striking film, the A-listers deliver, as mentioned, with Hardy, Theron and Hoult leading the way. Hoult's mad antics, particularly in the early stages of the film, counterbalance nicely with the grim coolness of Hardy and Theron's characters. It should be noted that I did not even think about Mel Gibson or what he might have done with the role in this film once during it, which should stand as a testament to Hardy's performance. Keays-Byrne is as intimidating and terrific as he was in 1978, and the women who portray the five wives definitely don't reflect the typical traits of damsels in distress. This is as much a testament to Miller's storyboard script as it is to the acting skills of the women in question, led by Rose Huntington-Whiteley.Some viewers may say that Mad Max:Fury Road lacks plot, story and even character development. But I don't know if any of that is necessary in the action-packed thrill ride that is the most recent product of George Miller's marvelous imagination.",4
"  My third favorite actor meets my original first favorite actress vis-á-vis? Yes, please. Neither disappointed and, together, they brought George Miller's artistic view of a post-apacolyptic world to the screen. The film was beautiful, funny, and insane, which are all things you'd probably want from a Mad Max movie.",5
"  Everything i wanted out of this movie, i received. Storyline is adequate if not mildly interesting, but thats NOT what this is about. Its a slobberknocker and a damn fine one at that.",5
  The best movie from 21st century,5
  Basically one big very well done car chase. Less bondage gear this time.,4
"  I give it one full star, because of the really good visuals, cinematography and action sequences choreography. I mean, this movie should have been the sequel, Mr. Miller, am i right? After the 10% storytelling at the beginning, you're foisted with 2 hours of non-stop, adrenaline rush and intense madness, which sounds okay if you are into that, but there is just no chance to enjoy such a piece, without vomiting at some point. It's like a techno club, you're pumped as you walk inside, but after 1 hour you just want to blow your head clean off and lay on the ground for a little bit. It gets annoying quickly, and even the great Hardy + Theron presence can't get it on the right side of the road. The only right this really big action ""scene"" did was that it left viewers wanting more at the end, because they pretty much received no actual development throughout the whole movie. It can grow into a very nice franchise, as it predecessor did, if they invest a little more effort in the story.",1
"  The best action film since ever. Visually and technically phenomenal, Fury Road brings out the best in itself while adding an element of surprise: Heart.That's right, there's a story, and it's a good one too. The surface will make itself out to be a nonstop bloodbath, but, and while that's not completely false, it's just simply not true. There is symbolism for a bigger picture in this film, and there is a sense of chaos and sadness that is almost palpable in some of the more dramatic scenes throughout. An absolute wonder.",5
  A pleasant madness. An amazing action movie.,5
  The long dead story of Mad Max roars back to life with this wild new installment that brings the franchise back to life. From the first frame you are consumed by the wasteland and strapped into a non stop thrill ride that never slows down or shows mercy (not to mention a hefty amount of compelling themes and narratives).,5
"  Well that was amazing! Amazing attention to detail, continuous adrenal rush, bad-assed female heroic lead. Super creative! Glad I finally saw this. :)",5
  Amazing movie! Stayed true to the original!,4
"  One of the worst movies I've ever seen a part of. Saw it in the theatre the first time, and walked out after repeatedly thinking ""why the hell am I wasting my time watching this crap?"". Saw rave reviews all around and decided to give it another go. Made it to the rediculous guitar-dude strapped to an amp-wagon. Deleted it off my harddrive 0.003 seconds later.I'm reading reviews to understand how anyone could possibly enjoy this heap of nonsense, but I just don't get it. Who cares about cinematography or ""real"" vs ""cgi"" when you're watching the absolute worst film of all time. There is no story, no direction, every character is ridiculously underdeveloped and the ""world"" that it's set in isn't even constructed according to the laws of what's possible and what isn't. Still people rave about how meticulously it is designed, and how it's a metaphore for the underlying storyline? Am I delusional? Is everyone else?",0
"  This is one of the dumbest, most hollow pieces of shit I have ever seen in my life.",2
"  Mad Max Fury Road came out of nowhere and was a fun exhilarating joy ride throughout the entire film. When the soundtrack booms as exciting action plays, you can't help but feel adrenaline rushing through your veins. Everything was great about it, but if it had more of a story, it would be perfect.",4
  Really? Best movie of 2015??,1
  An action-packed movie which told a moving story driven by its characters and the world in which they inhabit,4
"  With its amazing use of Practical effects, and character building. Fury Road soars above any action flicks to come out in the last decade. It was the best reviewed movie of 2015 and is already clear will become a classic in the future.",5
"  There are some confounding and head-scratching moments and not everything always makes sense. But as a movie lover and an independent filmmaker, I admire everything that happens in this film. All the set-pieces are beautifully done and exhilarating to watch, and Charlize Theron gives one of her best performances as Furiosa. George Miller is back on his game. Hold on tight, it'll blow your mind. Mad Max: Fury Road is a high-octane, unstoppable thrill ride.",4
  Watched this movie a year after the immense hype surrounding it had dissipated and yet I still left pleasantly surprised. The world-building elements of this movie worked so well and the action was beautifully choreographed and executed.,4
"  Great in everyway: picture, acting, editing and storyline.",4
  Riveting. Probably more action than I've ever seen in one movie and you actually care about the characters simultaneously.,4
"  The plot is bad,the pace is bad,the dialogue is bad.Its incredibly boring,the only redeemable thing about it is the visuals.",0
"  What is there to be said that hasn't already been said? Of all the action movies you're ever likely to see this is the best one. The acting is fantastic and each one is given a character that you can relate to. The story is a chase movie, but it's a simple it is so primal in theme that anyone can relate to it. The villain is intimidating and every stake, action, and decision has real consequences. Everyone from fans of good story telling, to fans of good acting, to lovers of cinema in general will love this movie. In fifty years' time, this movie will be remembered, studied, and loved by future generations of movie goers long after so many other cheesy action flicks, and many films in general are long forgotten. Count on it.",5
  A well made action movie with a primitive uninteresting plot.,4
  It was really fun to watch if you in the mood for little dialog,4
  Breathtaking FX and incredibly shot cinematography make this new Mad Max feature the best action film I have seen this decade,5
  Action Action and Action ! Wow ! This was Amazing ...,4
"  Horrible movie. Took me about three or four sessions to get through it. I looked up the reviews which said the movie was great so I decided to finish. Wish I hadn't. On the plus side, I'm glad I didn't pay money to see this movie. This movie is a car chase, shooting, explosions, motorcycles and a guitar player, rinse and repeat ad nauseum. Welcome to the department of redundancy department. I have no explanation why so many people would think this is some sort of masterpiece. It isn't.",0
"  Its the perfect guy movie. Things blow up for a while, they pause while girls wearing white shower down. Then things blow up the rest of the movie.",5
"  There are probably so many great reviews for this movie that there is nothing I could say that would do the film justice, but if I had to only do one review for a movie, this would be it. George Miller's vision of the apocalypse is an absolute masterpiece, and will go down as one of the greatest, if not THE greatest action movie ever made. This movie is about a ruling tyrant whose wives are stolen from him by a rebellious imperator, played by Charlize Theron. I think what most people appreciate about a film like this is the practical effects that went into it, and the extreme attention to detail to form this world that the director puts you in. These vehicles are all real, and had to be built from scratch, and each of them is like a character in the movie. The characters go from untrusting and ready to kill each other, to sacrificing themselves to save each other. This is the ultimate hero's journey story. Charlize did such a great job of being a badass. Tom Hardy did a good job too, although I wonder why Mel Gibson did not get asked to do the role. Hugh Keays Byrne is the ultimate villain as Immortan Joe, the warlord who will stop at nothing to recover ""his property."" There's too many things to list that this movie did right, so just do yourself a favor, and fall in love with this film like every other person who has seen it.",5
  Great Entertainment.Well Cast Roles.,4
  yes 5 stars!!! A rating. A thrill ride til the end. The week it came out to theaters I saw it 3 times if the first week. This was well worth the wait and hopefully I don't have to wait so long for a follow up.,5
  Shockingly poor..!!! Lost all faith in this site if this is top movie!,0
"  Great! Not as amazing as the critics said, 4 stars is a reasonable rating!",4
  How George Miller got away with this is beyond me. I like to imagine he had snipers on the set with orders to shoot any execs who showed up.,5
"  With strong direction, astounding visuals and grand set pieces, Mad Max: Fury Road proves you don't need an in-depth story to create one of the greatest action films of all time using strong lead characters, a post-apocalyptic background and a whole lot of mesmerizing action scenes taking place in one car ride.",5
  In my top 5 of all tine.,0
"  I don't get all the love for this movie. For a film with an R-rating, his could have been way more violent.",2
  Love that Tom Hardy can bring so much depth just by a series of grunts. Charlize is my hero. Can we name our daughter Furiosa?,5
"  Right let's get some things off the bat, it's great, fantastic wonderful, if you like action movies this is kind of the neplus ultra, but there is a problem and it's a really, really big one. Namely, it's too long, about half an hour too long,and it's only 2 hours so about a quarter of it needs to go, I don't care if it's amazing stuff kill your darlings, if you'd never shown the film no one would notice it gone. The last time we had a film that we could say ""how great it is to have a summer blockbuster that's actually fantastic and gets nominated for loads of oscars"" was gravity, and that was 90 minutes long and was essentially an exploitation film with a huge budget, got in, told the taut thriller, got out, wonderful. When a quarter of your film gets tiring, especially in a film of this kind of break neck pacing, that's a major problem. Now don't get me wrong, I love the film, I own it on DVD, the cinematography is amazing, the effects stunning and oscar winning, the costumes even more amazing and also oscar winning, no where else will you find a blockbuster film showing in multiplexes with a major antagonist wearing nipple clamps, I'm sorry but that alone will make it always have a place in my heart. Taut pacing, a convincing world as immersive as Blade Runner, and several kick ass ladies, make Mad Max: Fury Road a success, and an instruction manual for how to do Hollywood action in the future.",4
"  NO movie should ever get 5 stars. There's ALWAYS room for improvement. With that said this one gets as close to 5 stars as it can. IF you are a Mad Max fan, WATCH THIS. Amazing chemistry between Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy. The stunts, driving, score, acting, and costume design was about as perfect as you can get. Maybe later I'll do a more thorough review but for now I will leave it as this... If you are a fan of action, post apocalypse settings, strong acting, and gripping story lines, SEE THIS MOVIE.",4
"  One of the best movies of the year by miles (no pun intended). Emotional, thrilling, and amazing to withhold.",5
"  Mad Max contains a ton of action, a lot of explosion and some confussion that make you be more interested in the movie.UPDATE: after a second view, I refuse to put this movie a low rating,",5
  Complex but great movie to watch,4
  The worst movie I have ever seen.,0
"  This became one of my favorite movies of all time! Director George Miller created a masterpiece. Charlize Theron as Furiosa, she will be remembered as an icon just like Sigourney Weaver in Aliens and Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. Mad Max Fury Road is one of the greatest films ever made and will most definitely be remembered as a classic of the 21st century. The movie is absolutely amazing, beautiful, incredibly made. I love it, I love it! ""WHAT A DAY, WHAT A LOVELY DAY!""",5
"  When I first saw the trailer for this film I said to myself it's just another cash grab from a franchise that was once very good for the first two installments then turned sour with the third. However, now that I've seen this film, I've realised that's it's true craftsman - ship, the director wanted to make something great and I could tell and in the final result he did! the cinematography in this film is spectacular, avatar level I would say, with outstanding action and beautiful shots of a desert; I felt like I was there! the cons of this film, it's called MAD MAX FURY ROAD not the furiousa movie! Charlize Theron stole the spotlight from hardy! for a fourth installment it's a great film and a mile stone in cinema!",4

"  I live, I die. I LIVE AGAIN!",2
"  Furiosa is outdated. It isn't the 90s anymore. New movies and TV shows featuring strong female characters are made all the time. What was once a revolutionary concept has become commonplace. A female character being strong and independent should meet the same level of praise as a tracking shot. All Furiosa accomplishes by shouting ""We are not things!"" is reaffirm something that 90% of people in the western world already know.",0
  A blockbuster film that makes all others blockbuster look generic.,5
"  Compared to the last three this movie is a big piece of shit, first off I hate CGI with a passion.What I would like to see is Mel Gibson as an old man Max, it would make sense considering the timeline. Then they could have added any side kick as his co-star. Post-apocalyptic movies are obviously fantasy but this one tops the cake it's not even halfway real feeling. There's no mystery, there's definitely no suspense , very little story, I don't understand the direction of this movie.Other than the bad CGI.",1
"  If remakes or reinventions were this good, nobody would ever complain.",4
  Nope. The video game had a more memorable plot.,2
  Not as good as the other Mad max movies with Mel Gibson. The only thing I liked was the intense action in later half of it.,1
"  Great googley moogley! What a spectacle! Solid acting drives the action sequences which are high-key and fast-cut. Multi-layered so all can enjoy; if you need dramatic backstory? Its there - you just have to dig for it and not expect to get spoon fed. You just want to see cars go boom? That's there too. If you like both of those aspects you will be shiny and chrome all the way to Valhalla. Brilliant direction drives the stunning imagery. I can see how it's similar to The Road Warrior, but it feels less so in the end, but comparing to the original is oddly enough an apples-to-oranges comparison. Hardy plays it great but Theron steals the show. Strong yet human and real and tougher than you, she delivers through and through.. Her portrait of Furiosa is nothing short of epic and it's her sub-plot that drives most of the movie. Even the redemption of the warboy outshines Max. Using Max as the pallet to mix the other stories is a brilliant bit of film making. There was no need to make this a Mad Max movie and I suspect it was a device Miller needed to get the studios on board. They just could have made a new movie titled after the main character, which isn't Max. Its super-fantastic! Best film of the year for me.",4
  Mad Max made me a Sad Max,0

  Tom Hardy filmed movie in 20 words...,4
"  The long-awaited revival of the Mad Max franchise was well worth the wait, as not only is it the best of the series, but it's the gold standard for contemporary action films. George Miller reinvents his post-apocalypse for a post-videogame world, but it causes for a very imaginative look that's as exhilarating as it is playful. Of even more import, the film manages to be both a 2 hour car chase, as well as an adventure movie with a good storyline. Don't be surprised if this machismo-leaking movie gets you choked up a bit, as it's really damn good, and likely the best popcorn movie you'll see all summer.",4

  better then I thought don't know if there's a 3 coming but I hope there is its like borderlands irl,5
"  This is a story that realizes heavily on practical effects and cinematography, but with that the acting is great and the action scenes are amazing. This Best Picture nominee proves to us that not all action movies have to be the same generic plot, and I'll admit I saw this movie uninterested in the beginning, but once I saw the whole thing I was extremely impressed. I've never even seen the originals, but I'm ready for the next one.",4
  Mad Max Fury Road is the best action film of the year. The 4th installment in the Mad Max Trilogy simply about a car that goes the wrong way and needs to get back. Tom Hardy fails to disappoint in this movie with amazing acting to portray the character of mad max But Furiosa stands out the most in this movie one of the best female leads of the year. Mad Max Fury Road is for sure a must watch if you like action films. This movie has some the best Visuals of the last 5 years. Max Max Fury Road is the best in the franchise. What a lovely day to rewatch Fury Road,4
"  First i need to make it clear i still love The Road Warrior very much so i didnt find this as better or worse than TRW but equally as entertaining and great. So much so that it could stand on its own without any of the previous films had it been made by itself. The action is great, the scenery spectacular, and Charlize kicking some major ass. I can kind of see why people may have thought this was feminist driven because in some of the scenes they really did water down Max's ability to be a badass. While he had some great scenes i think it would of been better had a couple of the scenes actually allowed him to show and strut his own stuff. But its of minor consequence in the long run as it didnt hurt the movie any and more of just a personal preference for me as the viewer. Im also convinced that this is supposed to take place after the first 3 due to some of the flashbacks in the film. I also loved the fact that there were more groups of villains than just the ones from the Citadel as it certainly added to more of the mayhem. Overall loved this flick as it wasnt a letdown at all.10/10",5
  I can talk about this movie eternally.But I can also combine everything in three words:Extremly Fu##ing Amazing.,5
"  absolute masterpiece... cinematography,music, actors...",5
"  6/26/2016: Loved this movie! Tons of action! Easily the best Mad Max yet! May be the most action packed film I have ever seen! An appearance by Gibson would have been pretty cool, too bad that didn't happen. Hopefully more films will follow!",5
  You gotta be fuckin' shitting me. 97% score? This movie was so fuckin' retarded. It was nothing a but a 2 hour car chase. You guys don't know shit about movies.,0
"  This simply was not a very good movie. I was tricked into watching this by friends who claimed Charlize Theron's performance was awesome (it wasn't) and a Fresh Air interview with the writer and director. Side note: somehow, I didn't realize that he also did ""Babe"" until hearing the interview. ""Babe"" is such a charming movie and high on my desert island list. Yet, this ""Mad Max"" was not fun, but did have a few interesting concepts (the guitar that shoots flames, for example). The Amazonian tribe from whence Theron's character originated could have been a really interesting twist. Instead, they race stupidly back and forth across the desert into extinction. I cannot recommend it.",1
  Great Acton film. None stop thrill ride,4
"  Mad Max: Fury Road bring back the universe for the fourth time, and it's loud, intense and everything a Mad Max fan was probably hoping for, a really well done movie. Full of amazing stunts and action, that looks so amazing on screen. Definitely one of the greatest action movies so far on film.",5
  I'm not with the mad max movies or games,0
"  Una de las mejores películas de acción que he visto últimamente. Perfectamente filmada, es un espectáculo visual excesivo, intenso, épico. Tom Hardy increíble donde todo lo da con el rostro y que decir de Charlize Theron y su maravillosa furiosa. Espectacular.",4
  the best mad max yet by far.,5
  This movie sucks - why do so many people like it - I don't get it.,0
"  Best movie of 2015 definitely. George Miller creation keeps us awake till the end. Breathtaking action and road rage that Miller keeps from us for so many years finally gives us back in mad franchise sequel. Every planed scene and desert wasteland is escape to mad adventure that you can't get out until the end of the movie. Vehicles and chase is portrayed with power in them and badass destruction. Once more Hardy shows us that he is capable of doing seriously fantastic movies and giving us special performance. Charlize as Furiousa is something special as she takes us to journey of good and mad. As Tolkien wrote Lord of the Rings universe, George Miller gave us Mad Max universe. 100/100",5
"  Dumb like the drums it rides on...worst plot, just ridiculously stupid fight scenes, and zero character development with a plot that literally goes nowhere and is more than predictable and unexciting. It took me 4 viewing to get through it.",0
  I simply do not understand how this can be near the top. It made my eyes bleed to watch it was so poor. Maybe people like special effects for their ownsake?,1
"  One of the most overrated films I've ever paid to see. A snooze fest with zero dialog, zero character development, & zero plot. I'm sure there will be a sequel...that I won't watch.",1
  Such an excellent movie with the great cast and storyline. The visual effects is fantastic too.,5
"  Possibility the worst thing I have ever seen. No lines, no explanation of visions or events, and terrible special effects. I am very glad that I didn't pay to see it at the theater.",0
"  While it has nice visuals and cinematography, the story just isn't there. This flows more like a video game where it's basically long drawn out car chases broken up by a few short cutscenes. It doesn't really have a developed, coherent plot. If you like visually stunning mindless action I could would see where this would be appealing, it's just not for me.",2
"  A 2 hour long car chase. Yawn. I don't get the hype at all. Visual effects were great, but after about half an hour, you begin to realize that nothing different will happen for the rest of the movie.",1
  This movie is amazing. there is so much detail in the characters and action. Great.,5
"  What a great, fun movie. It even has a good story to tell, so that's good. The action is so stylized and cool that even if there was a badly-told story I wouldn't really mind. I agree with YMS on this one. This should be called Mad Max: Fun Road.",4
"  I'm not anti-remake. In fact, there are a lot of movies from my childhood and before that where I think they could really use a re-make. Mad Max is one of those 80s movies where after re-watching it as an adult, it really doesn't hold up. So when I heard they were doing a new version of Mad Max, I welcomed it. It REALLY needed another try. This is one of those rare re-makes where the new version completely blows away the original. It's not even close. Tremendous action, some stunning visuals ... it was great.",4
  The only mistake on this movie is that it ends. This is simply beautiful,4
"  So over rated. It's nonot stop action and that's a bad thing? Yes, i love action, suspense etc... but way try hard and over stimulating. I feel asleep 3 times trying 2 watch this. Boo to ratings... number one movie my a $$",0
"  MAD MAX: FURY ROAD contains complex practical action while maintaining the thrill of a good action movie, and what sets it apart from so many others is that it never lets up and never feels like it needs to.",4
"  Incredible action sequences, well made in-depth characters, outstanding production value, thrilling, and almost everything you could wish for in an action movie without a mixed up mess like other movies. Sure to be loved my Mad Max fans and others also.",5
"  Subtlety is a luxury this film doesn't desire dwelling upon. If you're not a fan of explosions and roaring engines, this isn't for you, however what's left is a classic story enjoyable to all and a thrilling blockbuster experience for those who have the proper home theater setups. I give it a 4.5 because this isn't exactly a genre I personally enjoy, but it shines as a powerful film regardless.",4
"  Every scene was action, action, action and action (oh and did I did I mention action too?). This movie is the best action movie my eyes ever laid upon. There were thrills and other elements that really fit well in the film and because of that I literally never looked away. It didn't make its atmphosphere too dark like I'd expect from the start because of the backstory and such and beacause of that, I really, really had fun with this film. If you didn't like this, then go see a doctor.",5
  Meh. Vehicles were cool though.,2
"  I'm not sure if everyone is mental, blind, or 8 years old. I love these actors, and I love action thrillers. This was a hodge podge of terribly executed film. Terrible story, poor acting, lack of substance.",0
"  Fun, yet intense, action movie. The filters made the film look cheap and were unnecessary. Definitely watch this film.",4
  A great action film. Although it seems that it is just madness and destruction in the film it has a fair share of heart. Tom Hardy does a good job but nothing special like Mel Gibson. Still One of the best films of 2015.,4
  THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN.,5
  One of the top 3 best movies of 2015.,5
"  One of the worst movies I've seen this year. The script was especially terribly written. Cinematography was well executed though. Overall, waste of time watching this film.",1
"  This movie is so amazing, so perfect, that I am genuinely worried when we'll see anything like it again. This was a film that I don't think anyone wanted, but it's the one film we all needed. It is perfect. As someone who adores classics from the 80's such as Alien(s), the Terminators, the Indiana Jones and Star Wars.etc. it''s great to have a movie that the next generation will look back on in 30 years like I do to the aformentioned movies.",5
"  There's nothing like the old school. Directed by a 70-year-old director, who can be more energetic, fresh, inventive and imaginative, who knows how to have a wonderful look on the woman, who is the one who can give life, hope and comfort in a world dominated by violence, from ' oppression and tyranny. Furious (played by beautiful Charlize Theron, tough and gritty) is the one who moves history, and goes open our hearts we mind to a Max (played by a taciturn and talented Tom Hardy). A mention are the images that offer us a world adrift but of great impact and beauty, thanks to a superb direction. The action scenes are something that either Bay or Snyder could have in a great directing, as he would Miller.",5
"  Just horrible, it's over hyped. I wanted to like this movie, I really did, but the movie couldn't keep my attention for much long, maybe because of the horrible acting of the supporting casts, or the much worse story itself, but luckily I got through it. The only reason I am giving it even a 2 is because of the action scenes which weren't that bad and because of how well Charlize and Tom performed their roles in the movie.",2
"  teeeeerrrrrrribbbbllleeee. lacked interest, plot, story, coherence and generally Mad Max.",0
"  Complete garbage! No plot, no point, lousy characters, The guy playing Max is a bore! It's all CGI with people engaged in combat while driving really fast. We've already seen that! It was called Thunderdome! And Thunderdome did it much better! Preachy politically correct hollywood drivel dripping with CGI. That's why some critics loved it so much but it's really a pointless waste of time.",0
  Flat story. Nothing happens just cruisin' around in the sands.,1
  Mad Max starts a out a little psychotic in this episode. The whole thing was a chase scene.,4
"  As early as the opening sequence, I knew this was going to be a painful cinematic experience. The editing was so poorly executed, the constant speeding up of frames gave the action such a cheesy feel. And while the amount of real-life stunts was impressive, the quality of any CGI or green screen used was terrible. I could go on further about the lack of depth to the plot and storytelling, but I wasted enough time watching the movie, I won't waste more writing about it.",2
"  One of the best action movies of the decade. Seldom do I give a 5 star rating since even good movies have flaws. But this one has so little of them, and such does not even matter.Outstanding sound effects and use of colours. Visually popping are those explosions and even the sky and sand looks amazing, while the score is moving and spot on. Combine the two and we get the famous Australian dystopian world of Mad Max, so mesmerizing, enchanting.Everything is a marvel to behold. George's direction is exceptional. He creates new cinematic techniques of conveying action sequence without much reliance of cliche shots. The end product is very fast-paced, effectively creating the sense chaos that comes with good action sequences. Ambitious is one word to sum this up.As the background characters yell weird monologues, while others swing to and fro over the War Rig commencing more and more crazy, feral action, the films keeps on delivering the thrills under such a unique ambience, and I can't help but be captivated by every one of its key moments. Marvel, X men, DC dominate the box office nowadays, but those action scenes are just for fun. Airport scene from CA: Civil War for instance, the one scene everyone extols, is admittedly for fan indulgence and fun. Fury Road is alone, but it is much more. It is of higher quality, and instead of delivering sheer fun it thrills. Hope that there are people like George who realizes how important these films are and continue to make more of them in the near future.",5
"  Was not impressed with the remake what so ever. I'm sorry but while I can possibly come to let go of crazy Mel doing the role I just didn't really connect with any of the characters in this movie because they felt more of silhouettes of characters than every possessing any real substance. In fact this was really apparent in every character in this movie as you didn't get to get to know about them really feel like you could relate to them. At least in the original movie when Max's wife was run down out in the middle of the road you felt the horror and disgust of what was going on and could sympathize with Max for vengence. However this movie had none of that real grit teeth clenching moments where you could identify with any character. Furthermore, it just pained me to see how secondary they Max himself when he was what all of em were every about. No longer was he intelligent and cunning he just seems empty and stale like the very theme of this movie. To say more, It just seemed like this movie was nothing but one long ass car chase there an unbelievable dusty surroundings that looked like a back lot of any movie studio and not anything familiar to the Australian Outback. Which brings me to the next thing I hate about this movie was just didn't feel the apocalyptic surroundings as i did with the 2 original movies and that really took me out of the movie big time to carry the backdrop of the chaos of the tone of the film. it was the same reason that beyond thunderdome in my eyes was an abomination. This made it terrible because it lacked that antagonist feel of appending doom that was always lurking near to what was going around Max in any other film. Overall this movie was nothing more than an abortion of everything I loved about Mad Max in the comics or in the films.",1
"  absolute garbage, overhyped",0
"  Con una impresionante fotografía, banda sonora, efectos visuales y grandes dosis de acción ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" se convierte en una de los mejores films de persecución de la historia del cine.Nos introducen a Mad Max (Tom Hardy) siendo capturado por los War Boys, un grupo que rinde culto a Immortal Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), un líder tirano que dirige una pequeña sociedad en un mundo post apocalíptico. El protagonista queda atrapado en medio de una misión del opresor que inicia un convoy para conseguir gasolina y municiones.Durante el viaje se desata la caza de Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), una comandante de Immortal Joe. Ella secuestra a sus esposas con el fin de rescatarlas y llevarlas al Paraje Verde, aprovechando el caos Max se une al escuadrón de chicas en búsqueda de su libertad.La película tiene muchos puntos a favor, además de los ya mencionados, suma bastante el rol de Max, siendo un héroe silencioso que de cierta forma es más un espectador que un líder. La actuación es soberbia, hay mucho trabajo de parte de los actores y la dirección para que sean las miradas y los gestos el principal medio de comunicación.Un punto cuestionable es la escasa información que nos brinda la historia, hay muchos elementos sueltos que quedan a para especulación o dar por sentado, pues en ningún punto la película vuelve sobre sus pasos.Si buscas entretenimiento ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" es una excelente elección, es un largometraje muy vertiginoso, con escenas impactantes y acción con mucha testosterona.",4
"  Mad Max: Fury Road es la mejor pelicula de acción que jamas he visto. George Miller regresa después de 3 décadas para continuar con la saga ""MAD MAX"" y su retorno es glorioso y épico en todo sentido. El estilo de la trilogía original es respetada y se usa la misma formula pero con mejores efectos y mejor coreografía. Las escenas de acción son increíbles, fue un placer ver unas secuencias bien hechas y muy bien editadas en post-producción. Tom Hardy es tan buen Max como Mel Gibson y los fans estarán muy satisfechos con el resultado final. Literalmente, esta es la primera pelicula que de verdad, las 2 horas de pelicula son 2 horas de acción pura, emocionante, violenta y frenética. El clímax nunca cae, la historia nunca se vuelve floja.REPITO: Es la mejor pelicula de acción que he visto en mucho tiempo. Aplausos a todo el equipo, en especial al director, George Miller.",5
  Probably the best movie of 2015. Creative comic book disasters and war and violence all comes alive on screen. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron make a great on-screen duo who start off as stand-off foes but turn into allies. You will not be disappointed.,5
"  Excellent action movie. Perhaps the best I've seen in years. I won't waste your time going into a thousand details why I loved this, so I'll just say I highly recommend this film. Also, in my opinion, you don't have to watch any of the previous Mad Max movies to enjoy this one.",5
  One of the worst movies I've ever seen.,0
"  Having never watched mad max I went into this movie a bit sceptical, never being a fan of the post apocalyptic genre I did;t know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised when the movie started kicking off, I was at the edge of my seat and you can imagine why. The stunts were absolutely mind boggling, you feel as if a lot of the stuns are done on screen and not just CGIed into the movie. I was absolutely captivated and even The makeup and costumes really sold it for me, I really did feel as if the world went to hell and you've gotta fight for whatever's left. The set pieces and music set the tone for the whole movie, telling you that you're in for one hell of a ride. I wasn't too sold on the story though, I would actually say that it's kinda ridiculous. But you can't go into a movie like this expecting amazing story and in no way did any of the trailers or promotional items made me feel that way. That being said I loved Furiosa's character I really think that there should be more female roles like that but I wish the same could be said for Max. I really was't clear as to why he was doing the things he was doing, he has random flashes of memories but I couldn't help but walk out thinking about it, maybe it was cause I didn't watch the original movie, but I'm just nit picking at this point. The action and stunts along with setting the tone and just plain crazy scenes is where this movie shines. Just don't expect the most logical reason as to why everything's happening.",4
"  There and back again, a mute's tale.",5
"  ""Holy Sh*t"" is all I can say",5
"  I have nothing but good things to say about Mad Max: Fury Road. Every aspect of this film works for what it's trying to accomplish. Charlize Theron steals the show as Furiosa, and Tom Hardy does adequate work as the new Max. Junkie XL's driving score amps up the adrenaline. The feminist undertones are powerful without being annoying. Of course, Fury Road is an action movie first and foremost, so the most impressive part of this movie is the stunt work. What George Miller and company managed to accomplish with their practical effects is masterful, and the cinematography perfectly captures every bit of the action. The set and costume designers deserve props too for their contributions. All-in-all, Mad Max: Fury Road deserves every bit of praise it has earned. This is one of my favorite movies of all-time, and it gets better with each viewing. If you love action movies, you're doing yourself a disservice if you haven't seen it!",6
  Well... That movie came out of nowhere. Great film really surprised me,4
"  Action ? Yes. Visuals ? Sure. Scenario ? Not so much.I struggled to watch this in its entirety. The first 30 minutes set the tone perfectly : do not expect any coherence, depth of characters or, well, anything other than full in-you-face action here. Nothing stands up to scrutiny, no character holds up to any real logic, and of course it has nothing to do with the first movies of the same franchise.Let it be noted that Charlize Theron is the real main character here, and plays her part with talent and charisma, which sorely lack in Tom Hardy.",2
"  AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the feminist action film i have been waiting for my entire life :,)",5
"  When the denizens of the apocalypse thunder up in their fire-belching steel monstrosities, raving and drooling, invading the scrap of wasted earth you've dug into for shelter from the wind, screaming insanities, and blasphemies, you'll know who to thank: Dr. George Miller. Now, 70, the director, who one learns, indeed, finished his residency before fully succumbing to the dubious life of movie making, is one of the unacknowledged architects of the 21st Century, or at least it's most grandiose obsession - the end of the society. Miller's post-apocalypse vision has proven a cultural influence as seminal as George Romero's ""The Night of the Living Dead"" and it's unleashing of the zombie fixation that still flourishes without sign of a cure. Miller's second film in the the Mad Max series,""The Road Warrior,"" starring the then-untarnished and astonishing beauty of young Mel Gibson was, in 1980, the excelerant to the let-it-all-burn frustrations of disenfranchised youths everywhere. Miller's genius, beyond plumbing the arid roads of Aussie outback, ala Leone, as his revisionist Western wasteland ridden by monster trucks, was to populate his tale of society in its last stages of entropy with mutated punks and steroid-ripped glam rockers in glorious leather and chainmail. A product of the energy-crisis era, he distilled the lifeblood of the humanity down to precious drops of high octane, fought and died for, to be fed reverently into Big Daddy ""Ed Roth"" hot rods that roared in the dust, sustaining and taking life, while spewing flame like pyres lit to Moloch. Miller's was a wholly original vision - a ripping post-apolcalyptic yarn that tapped into Sex Pistol's anarchy and stoked mohawked youth's ambitions to be last-rockers-on-earth. As a seer of things to come, time has revealed the acuity of Miller's dysto-vision as matched only by steampunk grandaddy H.G. Welles and techno-paranoia of Orwell. Today's apocalpyse fashionistas, pierced, tribally tattooed and encyclopedicially-versed in automatic weapons from their endless practice at survivalist video games, are the spawn of good Dr. Miller's vision. And when the power plants grind to a halt and the mayhem begins, he may even be cursed for his mad tetralogy of the road being the source a self-fulling prophesy.",4
"  Not too impressed. But I am not typically impressed by so called Blockbusters. One of the most overrated recent movies, in my opinion.",2
"  Make me wish that whatever calamity tipped the world into the post-apocalyptic phase had been even more effective. Insufferable in that grinding, inane kind of way.",1
"  An action genre masterpiece. 2 hours of testosterone, explosions and frenziness.",5
"  I really like this movie One long car chase, with original characters, reminds me of the original.",4
"  I don't know how three films in the same franchise can be considered masterpieces, but the Mad Max series pulls it off.Mad Max: Fury Road isn't just one of the greatest action movies ever made, it's one of the greatest movies ever made. Period.",5
"  A really Fun movie, but I really wished if their where more dialogues.",4
"  You know, hope is a mistake. If you can't fix what's broken, you'll, uh... you'll go insane. ~ Max Rockatansky",5
"  Speaking as someone who dug the original the hardest, this is fairly close. When I saw George Millers' name just now, then I knew , it's the real deal. I can see how everyone is going to love this, and I do too. For some reason it always makes me and mine want to move to Australia. But in this case, my daughters really got into this one on account of the ancient biker lady with the sewing pouch full of ....what, you thought I was going to spoil it for someone? Anyway, they were like...""Mom, that's you!"" Which was both an insult and a compliment.",5
"  Serving as a huge inspiration for countless post-apocalyptic tales, the Mad Max series was the original progenitor of the merciless wasteland setting in the eighties. Since then it seemed that Mel Gibson, Warner Bros and director George Miller had left the series for good. After three decades of absence, Mad Max makes his thunderous return to the silver screen and the result is one incredibly enjoyable action flick.Mad Max Fury Road pursues a simplistic yet engaging plotline, which feels very distant from the previous films in the series; the world is little more than an endless wasteland with numerous bandit clans warring over the precious oil and water needed to sustain life. While being held captive by the War Boys, Max (Tom Hardy) seizes his chance to escape when War Rig driver Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) defies the clan's leader Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) to get a group of wives (who were specifically selected by Joe for breeding) to safety and possibly find a new home. From here, the tight-lipped Max forms a shaky alliance with Furiosa and it's full speed ahead across the wastes with Joe and other factions in hot pursuit. If you were expecting some action that the series is known for then Fury Road delivers in spades and then some; the film barrels along at top speed, only pausing to deliver a few moments of drama as the characters attempt to find a new home. It's complete madness, yet ironically this kind of plot is a perfect fit for both the ravaged setting and the characters that inhabit it. Despite not learning too much about how the wasteland came to be, it is still bursting with character and the psychotic clans go a long way towards selling the film's patented style which has been missing from the silver screen for so long.The characters of Mad Max Fury may feel a little lacking at first; they're certainly far less outspoken than your usual action heroes. But then you realise that the casting forms a tight parallel with the overall setting. If you're new to the series, you may be surprised that both Max and Furiosa are fairly quiet and sane when compared to the raving lunatics that populate the gangs of the wastes. When Theron and Hardy do have lines, they are delivered with the gruffness and seriousness you would expect from characters forced to survive in a world like this. Theron in particular makes her presence felt as a strong willed and determined heroine who often steals the spotlight from Max over the course of the film. The quiet protagonists contrast against the War Boys who are characterised by rambling jargon mixed with peculiar religious undertones that give hints and clues about the nature of their clan. Often times there's a wild range of facial expressions on the actor's faces that definitely put across far more than any dialogue can. Ultimately, Fury Road proves that a lot can be done without dialogue, which is certainly a welcome change from other films in the same genre.With a thirty-year gap between it and its predecessors; Mad Max Fury Road seizes every possible opportunity to push the boundaries of the series and the visual result is something to behold. The film is absolutely stunning, both from a technical and artistic standpoint. Imaginative car and costume designs put across the sheer chaos of the post-apocalyptic desert and both of these elements interact beautifully with the computer generated sandstorms. Then we have the chase sequences which all utilise practical effects, real stunt-work and pyrotechnics, meaning that the film never loses its punch no matter how many cars get tossed and mangled on-screen. Fury Road truly does honour its pedigree; you simply won't be able to take your eyes off the screen throughout the entirety of its run-time because the film succeeds very well at making its action impactful at every turn. Pulse-pounding sound effects and a rocking soundtrack also heighten the tension, whilst the cinematography is quick, clear and fluid despite the pure insanity of the action on-screen. Dare I say it, Mad Max Fury Road could be the most technically advanced movie ever to be based in an apocalyptic setting. You get the sense that the filmmakers didn't just want to bring Max back, but also wanted to set him apart from all other action sequences on the big screen.The post-apocalyptic setting is ripe for all kinds of stories and Mad Max Fury Road is the tip of the spear by a substantial margin. It revitalises and updates the series whilst not forgetting what made the previous three films such stand-outs. Strap yourselves in and get ready for one of the year's best action films, Fury Road is the most explosive and rip-roaring good time you will have at the cinema this summer.",4
"  Mad Max Fury Road is possibly, if not, one of the best action films ever produced. The directing pushed you into the action and was able to keep your attention throughout the entirety. The locations and acting worked hand in hand with this apocalyptic action movie, definitely a Fresh movie.",4
"  Wow what an accomplishment they made with the movie. Fantastic set pieces, amazing practical effects and good yet funny performances. Didn't think old movies could get good sequels anymore but this proved me wrong.",5
  An absolute spectacle!,5
  A non stop Metallica music video.,4
  Very good action ð???,5
"  Mad Max: Fury Road is thrilling from start to finish, it is crafted with such excellence and George Miller captures the post-apocalyptic landscape with such delicacy and ease its hard to believe. Not only is the film a beautiful masterpiece of cinema, but it should be recognized for its original storytelling, beautiful cinematography, amazing action and well done characters. Yes you can have all of that in a 2 hour car chase, and thats what astounds me.",5
"  Calling this movie one of the greatest action movies ever made is selling it just a bit too short, it's one of the greatest movies ever made. Period.A masterpiece with never a dull moment, George Miller has the highest point (so far) in his career with this astonishing movie.Tom Hardy as the iconic Max Rockatansky, and Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa star in this escort mission of epic proportions.Easily among the greatest action movies ever made, Fury Road ranks with Die Hard, The Bourne Ultimatum, and Lethal Weapon II as one of the greats.",5
  I never liked the original series. But this was something else.,4
"  Fun flick. Exhausting. Wanted a wee bit more of a plot. Very video game-ish, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.",4
  Visually stunning! Incredibly imaginative! A real masterpiece of filmmaking from visionary George Miller.,5
"  THIS IS A MOVIE. Mad Max cannot be the definition of anything because it is beyond so many simple categories. I may seem somewhat biased in this review but I don't give a shit, I LOVE THIS MOVIE. There are brief moments that hint at the sci-fi world that this masterpiece exists in. The action sequences are beautifully realistic with the rust and haze of the post apocalyptic wasteland. The characters are strong and charismatic drawing us into this seemingly impossible world. The concepts are insane and wonderful, and suddenly...Mos Eisley seems like everyday life. I could speak endlessly about how much I love this movie without stating a single flaw because to be frank, there are pretty much none.",5
"  Mad Max fury Road is the new steppingstone of action movies. After the Dar Knight I thought the action movies genre is dead. Once again at Warner Bros. proves us wrong. George Miller is a magnificent masterpiece by making this wonderful crazy work of picasso. Here are the few steppingstones raiders of the lost Ark, diehard, terminator two judgment day, The matrix, The Dark Knight, and now mad Max fury Road. This movie was incredible to see. I am very proud of you one of these people to witness this internal glory. And I promise to take you to the gates of Valhalla. Great film to witness. Go see it!! I saw one this when I first came out sorry for the late review Grade A perfect 10",5
  Was good to Watch Mad Max again as an adult. Loved the older ones when I was younger.,4
  Action packed throughout with a smooth running story makes Mad Max:Fury Road a crowd pleasing summer blockbuster.,4
"  An exceptional film that will blow your mind with its incredible characters, plot, and best of all action. An instant classic.",4
  This is an incredible masterpiece!That was my first opinion. After watchin this film over 20 times and I cant get over it! Wow!! Everything is just perfectly perfect!!!!,5
  Action the whole way through. Def on the edge of my seat the entire time,5
"  Great visuals, but being a fan of the original Mad Max I was very deluded by the movie. Too much chase and action, go see the original Mad Max and feel the pain of a family destroyed, the need for vengeance in an empty and destroyed world where there is no law. In this movie I found a lot of beautiful visuals, but they were so exaggerated as to look ridicolous (monkey bikes throwing nades on the truck? No splinters killing people inside? A truckload of dust into the engine and not even a cough?). While the previous movies of the franchise had a lot of visual chaos too, it was interwoven with tranquil scenes with many dialogues, things that conveyed the story and every new movie was connected to the previous by something: the car, the shotgun, etc. And it connected with other movies of the same theme too. This one only connects with itself and in the end just seems a casual excuse for a chase movie. I vastly prefer the Transporter franchise or Fast and Furious if I want to see a chase.",2
  Did anyone else notice that all the good girls ride airheads?,5
  So I finally sat through this one. Took me three tries and I really don't understand the hype. Maybe I didn't get it but what's happening besides the action sequences. To me this felt like one long shot of choreographed explosions and extensive violence with little to no character development or background story. If it's all about vengeance the good. Go have your vengeance. I somehow expected a little more depth.,2
"  Awesome visuals, so-so storyline. The two main characters were fun to watch, but had very little dialogue to hold my attention.",2
"  Enjoyable ""ride,"" but basically no plot...",2
"  With incredible action scenes that will undoubtedly stand the test of time, intriguing characters, and a handful of fantastic performances, Mad Max: Fury Road is an amazing visual experience and a very well made film.",4
  Thelma and Louise on steroids.,5
"  This time you can believe the hype: Fury Road is one of the most brutal and bone-crunching action films in recent memory, one of the boldest, most original experiences of the year and probably one of the smartest works of dystopian sci-fi to emerge from the current deluge of the same.",5
  This movie surprised me a whole lot. Great filmmaking by George Miller. Lot of intense action sequences. Great performance by Charlize Theron.,4
  Intense flick! Great action throughout.,4
"  Furiousa's Road: Mad MaxFury road is the fourth installment in George Miller's Mad Max saga. This time around the titular character who used to be portrayed by Mel Gibson, has not been given to Tom Hardy. The film follows a car chase which their objective is to keep Immoten Joe's wives away from him.First of all, this is definitely not Maxs story for the main character of this film is clearly Imperator Furiousa, who's determination and heroics set the course for the coolest action movie in recent memory. The character is brilliantly portrayed by Charlize Theron, proving she can do more serious roles. The action is mind blowing and fantastic. It is incredible in every sense of the word. The practical effects are jaw dropping, filled with flying cars, stunt work and gigantic explosions literally flying through the the screen. This plus a great percussion infused score by Hans Zimmer protÃ (C)gÃ (C) Junkie XL. The story is also good, filled with emotional, funny, and surprising moments, but all in all the films biggest points are for its action and Miller's fantastic direction. This is how you make an action movie.One small problem with the film was how Tom Hardys voice did not fit well with the sound mix. It felt more defined, as if he had rerecorded all the scenes he spoke in. It was distracting to see him character speak on screen. Another thing I found questionable was how he barely spoke, as an audience member who hasn't seen the previous 3, I am not sure if he is supposed to be a man of few words, even Nicholas Hoult, who was great in this film, has more lines than hardy, the titular character.This film was great, it surprised me as a person who was not very engaged by the trailers. Though It was actually Furiousa's story, it was still very enjoyable. Mad max's character had some development problems but the film remained crazy, over the top, and beautiful. This is how action should be made. And it takes a 70 year old to get it done right. Rating: 8.4 (A-)",4
"  A thrill ride from start to finish - Mad Max: Fury Road thrives on its non-stop, suspense-filled action sequences.",6
"  good effects, good camera, and all, but it's just a really bad movie in my opinion....",0
  Great movie. Strong Visuals. Action and acting good.,5
"  I didn't know what to expect coming into this movie. I had no idea what the story was, the beginning had me worried that it would be a little too ""Sci-Fi"" for my liking but this movie turned out pretty good. The fight scenes are insane and they are continuous. There is almost no down time whatsoever. I do think Max and Furiosa's crew being outnumbered so many times should have somehow created more problems for them but hey that's movies and that's what you come to expect. A lot of cool detail went into this movie and it had me on the edge of my seat for the most part. I did not expect to give it more than 3 stars coming in because this is not typically my type of movie. Go figured.",4
"  While I agree with hunterjt13 and others about the weakness of this movie I have to begin with the caveat that I really enjoyed watching ""Mad Max: Fury Road"". I enjoyed the mayhem, the big world depicted, the over-the-top characters... I even enjoyed what Charlize Theron and tom Hardy did with the characters they were depicting. If the movie is a commentary on modern society, or if the movie is a critique of sex slavery, or if the movie is a deep philosophic expose of the need to face our demons, I'll leave to other critics. I give the movie many stars because it is exactly what I anticipated it to be, namely, a balls-out nonstop fortissimo idiot-show of eye-bending, bone crunching violence and shit blowing up. There is little reason to ask for more in our day and age. That being said, the larger commentary on this video is parallel to the comments I made on Jurassic World (seen in the same evening as this film): a staggering amount of violence and a puerile plot. As I've already commented on the violence bit in the review of ""World"" this one receives the juvenile commentary. What happened to PLOT in cinema? Even action films in days of yore had a cohesive and somewhat interesting plot most of the time. The ones that did not, the grindhouse cinema movies of the 1970s et alia, received little praise and rightfully so. But this movie has a frickin' 97% rating from critics and 86: from the hoi poloi! Movies are not just for entertainment but are a medium to tell stories and when the story is thin the other flaws are magnified and no amount of Michael Baying the explosions, revving up the video ramping, or adding extra red dye to the blood bags can improve that weakness. In Fury Road the plot is this; escape the trolls, drive out with the trolls chasing, turn around and drive back with the trolls chasing, defeat the trolls. Really. What else is there in this movie? And though I might see it again, the grabbing power of that plot is so weak that I would just as soon crack open a beer and watch the crows attack my garbage cans. Sure there were some neat explosions, some guys on long poles doing maniacal things, a dwarf attached to an oxygen machine, some sexy chicks getting run over by tractors (what else, like I said, do you need in a movie, amiright?) ...but there was also a guitar-playing fella with no face strapped to one of the trollcars who played vamp music the entire time. Who auditioned for that coveted job? And when he auditioned why didn't he learn more than TWO FRICKIN' CHORDS? Were the judge trolls like, ""Uhhh, THAT GUY!""???? The soundtrack was like ""Barracuda"" without all the nuance - and on meth.And all the Deaths Heads (C) that covered everything ---cars, walls, ceilings of cars, necks, rock walls, tires on cars, grills of cars, cod pieces ... what? was there some company like ""Deaths Heads (C) Incorporated!"" saying, ""we got you covered, oh great Homunculus, sir""? when the chief troll demanded a Deaths Head (C) codpiece to adorn his groin? And how did these nubile creatures like Miss Kravitz, Miss Keough, and Miss Huntington-Whitely stay so pristine and lavender-smelling in the midst of this dusty, brutal, overheated world? After a long chase, wouldn't they start smelling like everyone else? And the ridiculous names ""Imperator Furiosa""? ""People Eater""? ""Corpus Collossus""? ""Rictus Erectus""? Hell - it sounds like something out of Spinal Tap or Loaded Diper. Might as well have had a character named ""Biggus Dickus"". None of this would have been problematic but that the story itself was a load of government cheese; enjoyable, tasty, but utterly worthless in the long run.Maybe that's my main beef with the beefcake in this film. The whole thing seems like it was written, directed, produced by some testosterone-foaming 12 year old boy who wanted to see how much he could mash up women, tear out fetuses from the stomachs of their mothers, explode drug-crazed rockpunk psychopaths, maim old people, depict fat women hooked up to milking machines, portray anemic albinos hooked up to human blood bags, or explode vehicles in spectacular fashions. It is two hours of fortississimo violence, noise, revving engines, vamping guitars, ramping cameras, and sand. Without an ounce of story. But if you like that sort of thing? Give it four stars out of five as I have so done. There is little reason to ask for more in our day and age.",4
"  So much action, Beautiful Camera Direction,Great acting, defiantly a must see",4
  Nonstop insane action!,4
"  uh...wow....this movie seems to be trying to start a franchise....not my thing at all...it does go on and on...and, ironically, it basically gets you back to where it started.....glad I didn't see it in the theatre!!! Lots of show and no real go. In DESPERATE need of a story.",1
"  Well this was totally unexpected. I did expect this movie to be great. Okay, at best if I am being honest. The development hell this movie went through was pretty crazy. But, they definitely outdid themselves crafting a film better than any Mad Max that came before it arguably. Charlize Theron is also a real standout and honestly, probably should have received a Supporting Actress nomination. Well anyway, it was pretty nice seeing an action masterpiece nominated for Best Picture.",4
"  Loud, completly crazy and beautiful shot, George Miller's ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is one of the best action movies of this decade",5
"  I liked it a lot! Good Action, Good Story, and Great Stunts!!!!",4
  A damn wild ride that will leave you drooling. Everything from the production design to the beautiful camerawork makes you feel engulfed in this post-apocalyptic wasteland.,5
  Great storyline ... For a Mad Max movie. Amazing visuals. Plenty of action. What more could you want?,4
  This movie edged Tom Hardy to my all time favorite actors list.,5
"  To sum up Mad Max: Fury Road in one sentence, it'd be ""Fury Road lives up to the hype and then some"". Because Fury is amazing! Fury Road is a breathe of fresh air in a seemingly crowded over CGIed mess of an action movie genre. We haven't seen an action movie like this since the 2008 The Dark Knight. The design of the cars, costumes and makeup are fantastic, things I've never seen in a movie(be aware I've yet to watch any of the other Mad Max films, but will definitely do so after Fury Road). The cinematography and look of the film is gorgeous. Tom Hardy plays a great Max that has the potential to be even better in the next 2 movies he signed for. But Charlize Theron as Furiosa completely stole the show in Fury Road. She was awesome and badass character and really is kind of an inspiration to other women to fight for their rights and what they believe in. I honestly don't know why, but I felt that Charlize Theron deserved AT LEAST an Oscar Nomination for her role. The cherry on top out of all of this is the biggest reason why Fury Road is getting all the praise it deserves. The use of practical effects and real stunts. Little did I know that after watching Fury Road did I find out that most of this movie does not have any CGI. It's incredible, especially for an action movie as big as this. Which is why I emphasized why Fury Road is the king of the action movie genre, because it stands out from normal CGI filled action movies. George Miller, yet again created an action movie masterpiece that deserved his Oscar nomination. All in all, Mad Max: Fury Road is a masterpiece on a massive scale that is more than worthy of its 10 Oscar nominations and it's 6 wins. I don't think anything will come close to the kind of production and action Fury Road has done. Mad Max: The Wasteland can't come soon enough.",5
  I think this film is destined to become a cult.,5
"  I have watched this movie three times in a week and a half. It is amazing and I love the action, sounds, actors. It's amazing and I would love to see another one. I watched the older ones because I remembered watching Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome when I was younger, but they are nothing compared to this one. I can't wait for another Mad Max movie. Truly amazing.",5
  Shiny and Chrome and rewards at the gates of Valhalla for this one.,4
  AwesomeThe action is exciting The design and theme is emercive And the stuns are incredible My only problem is the characters They are not really that interesting Hell I can't even remember there names besides Max's,4
  One of my favorite movies of all time and quite possibly my favorite action movie of all time!! I could watch this over and over again.,5
"  The best action movie in decades. That being said, action is not all this movie has going for it. It actually has a surprising amount of feeling to it with Charlize Theron's character.Tom Hardy took over the Max Rockatansky role is great and really surprised me. For a person who had never previously seen a Mad Max film, i was so happy with how this movie turned out.",5
  Ook de 2e keer blijft het een geweldig bangelijke goeie film!,5
  This movie redeems every bad action film I've ever seen. It is amazing!,5
"  Pretty horrible movie. Mad Max is basically just a glorified taxi driver. This movie isn't even about Mad Max. I felt ripped off when I watched it. Also, all the women in it are sour, bitter, hateful feminists. Very unpleasant movie for Mad Max fans.",0
"  Mad Max is back! And yes, it's a lovely day.",4
  Good flick.. but but not the best Scifi movie ever.,4
  A rush from start to finish.,5
  Max Max Fury Road was a masterpiece. I give it 4/5 stars because it wasn't really my type of movie.,4
  The perfect action-movie of 2015 and one of my absolute favorites over all.,5
  This might be the best movie I have ever seen.,5
"  Mad Max: Fury Road has kept my eyes wide open the whole time, making me feel excited and dazzled with the picture's beauty. It is definitely one of my favorite movies now and one of the movies i'll watch thousand times.",4
"  This was quite possibly the worst movie I've seen in years. I have no idea how it got such good reviews. Despite impressive CG, I witnessed no redeemable qualities worth noting.",1
"  This movie would have been much better had it not been called Mad Max. it totally ruins the Mad Max film series. By calling it a Mad Max film the led me to have some high expectations...they failed. had it been just ""Furry Road"" with out the max character I would have given it 3 stars.",0
"  maybe it lacks a proper character development, some plot hole, a simple script (the whole movie is a major chase scene).. but who cares??... its pretty entertaining!!!, nicely directed, unique and memorable characters, fascinating cars, fortunately not too much CGI and tons of real action.",4
  A movie so bad I stopped watching it after 30 minutes,0
"  As much depth allowed by a legendary action film series, and then some.",5
"  It very impresive how so little dialog can build such an impressive world, Despite of being a full action film in a chaotic post apocalyptic world, the movie is not chaotic at all, Miller was able to guide you through this world and tell an impresive viceral story which resembles more a myth than an action film.",4
"  How can a movie with so much potential be so boring?? Synopsis, chased by bad guys, truck breaks down, continue chase and repeat. Pointless and yawn inducing!!",0
"  This is the craziest, out of the mind, most action packed, (insert whatever adjective that means madness here) movie that I had ever watched. You also can call it a brain massage, a visual feast,or an 1 hour plus of action feast. A enjoyable and satisfying experience for action movie fans. Oh what a day! What a lovely day!!!!",5
  This is how you do nonstop action.,4
"  Awesome car chasing/ action movie. Violent, sexy and so much fun to watch. Highlights all the time.",4
"  The special effects in this movie are stunning. If you've never even seen a Mad Max, it doesn't matter still worth a watch on the big screen.",4
  This movie attempts to be one thing and it accomplishes that it is beautiful and exciting from beginning to end it also receives five stars for re-watch ability,5
  Story probably written by 8 year old,2
  Furiosa And The Five Wives Of Fury Road is a piece of shit,1
  So exciting and action-packed,5
  I could not get past the idea that all the mechanical devices work perfectly and never run out of fuel inspite of not having the industrial base to support them. Lots of unnecessary gruesomeness and unexplained weirdness that did nothing to advance the story.,1
"  Worst movie ever, don't watch!",1
"  Mad Max is a spectacle. Perhaps the most beautiful action movie I've ever seen due to its fluid action sequences, intense color juxtaposition, and grand-scale set pieces. Its story is basic to the point of brilliance; the only thing you need to be concerned about is the gorgeous mayhem happening on screen.",4
  Worst film I've ever seen,0
"  Mad Max Fury Road advances the Action Movie genre from the 1980's and transforms. The greatest effects here is the intricate ballet of action movie moments woven sometimes layers deep into the long battle scenes, with a wide range of emotion. If The Road Warrior is Miller's Illiad, Mad Max Fury Road is his Aeneid.",4
  5 Estrellas para esta película.. lo mejor del 2015 sin duda..,0
  Exceeded all expectations.,5
"  The glorious non-stop action film that no one ever seems to get right anymore has returned! Not only that, but it has arrived within a fantastically-detailed and well-realised world that isn't afraid to be freaky or unconventional. instead, it thrives on such characteristics.The cast are great (even though Hardy really isn't doing that much) and it's Furiosa who comes out as the real star- she may well simply oust Mad Max altogether and take his place (as long as Theron doesn't start saying the kinds of things that Mel Gibson does...)It's a giant chase movie and it has a ton of action and instantly-quotable lines and a great villain and a rich and beautiful world to explore. I sound like a little boy as I try and summarise it but that's just how exciting this film is- seeing it was like watching Die Hard for the first time as a kid; the whole time I was just thinking 'man, that's awesome'. It's rare that a straight-up action film grabs me in that way anymore. With most good action flicks I' d add the usual 'switch your brain off and dig in' line but for this one you can rest assured- feel free to delve into the film's meaning/social commentary/whatever because enough care and attention has went into that that you might actually take some things away from it if you go down that route. This is a smart action film that is still an action film at its core- it isn't trying to make us think, it just wants to entertain us and gives us some extras to go with it. EVERYTHING LOOKS REAL TOO (I only saw one shot where I felt like the effects took me out of the movie- ONE SHOT OUT OF SO, SO, MANY OF THEM). I was looking too- I was trying to catch it out, but, no Fury Road packs a real punch and you can see it right in front of you (unless all of the dust gets in your eyes!Whilst I clearly love this film, I will say that I was somewhat disappointed with how it began to come to an end. It's satisfying and fair but I also found it somewhat anti-climactic and just a little too easy- this film could easily have went on for another half hour without it even slightly beginning to bore due to its fast pace and constant action. I think it went for a happy ending (well, 'happy' in the context of its deranged world) and I'm not sure that it had to play it quite so safe. Also I wasn't hugely interested in Max's flashbacks as they just didn't feel necessary with so much else going on. Anyway, enough talk- WATCH IT. IT IS GLORIOUS.",4
"  How did this movie get rated so highly? If you're 15 or under and like constant 5 second violent action clips continuously with little to no story line ""except getting to the green"", go for it. What a disappointment from the early first two. Horrible. I'm glad I saw it for free. It was hard to sit through the whole debacle.",0
"  What a stinker, where is Mel when u need him. They give one of Hollywood's great beauties a stump for an arm. This movie was perfect for a 15 yo male, with no discrimanatory taste. The male lead looked fat, angry, ugly, like he forgot his lines, in different scenes, no acting ability combined with poor direction. I'll bet most of the peeps who watched this never saw the original.",1
  Incredible visuals. Not sure if liked the plot. Still a great watch for a Friday evening.,4
  Full of intensity but that's about allThere was.,2
  Excellent! It will make you want to research the old ones again.,5
  Another critically acclaimed movie that was beyond crap.,0
"  I have seen 1500 plus movies in my life, this is the worst one I have ever seen in my 31 years on earth. I think the reviews must be fake. Not to mention all the twisted metal ripoffs.",0
"  This film was brilliantly handled. So well done, granted you'd need to absorb a lot of chaos & post apocalyptic scenarios but it's so wonderfully filmed & has a solid story structure. ð'?ð?»",5
"  Fantasy dystopian desert adventure in which the bad guys are stupid, ugly and shit shots and the good guys n gals never miss. Plenty of old vehicles that never break down and a script that involves a lot of grunting. Nothing in this film makes sense and it's more attractive feature is the warped surreal landscapes - though most of it looks like the Atakama.",2
  I feel this movie should have been called Furiosa: To the Max,4
"  Oh what a day, what a lovely day!",4
"  I saw the original mad max... it was violent, it had car battles, it had minimal character development. I had very realistic expectations going into the theater to see this new version.Never have I been more disappointed with a movie. The acting on both leads parts was mediocre at best, with the male lead switching from being well spoken to being capable of nothing but grunting.. The story line seems to have been written and edited by remedial English students, the characters are unbelievable and seriously lack any character development, it has horrible motorcycle stunts... and guys bouncing back and forth on poles of all things.and come on.. a flame-throwing guitar and fat women being milked for no explained reason to trade for gasoline to power the flame throwing guitar?... it's full of shitty clichés... badly cut scenes.. and lots of explosions. Save your money see anything else and you will be better off.",4
  utter rubbish omg you got this so wrong,0
  MM:FR was horrible. Fake looking CGI. Meaningless story. Wooden acting. Oh and unbelievable plot changes that you won't believe because they make no sense. Are these characters really this stupid???,1
"  I just saw Mad Max Fury Road for the first time. Luckily I did not pay to do so and the company received no benefit from my watching. Yes, the special effects and action are amazing...but it wasn't a movie. There was no plot. There was no character development and even a five minute introduction as they had in Road Warrior would have made the film more interesting. Total social justice warrior agenda and total garbage. Boycott Hollywood! I gave it a 1 star rating on IMBD and am going to go do the same at Rotten Tomatoes. This type of propaganda is just another example of how ideology ruins art.",0
"  From beginning to end, Mad Max: Fury Road is a non-stop, thrilling action film that manages to balance the characterization, effects, and direction of this chaotic dystopia in the most beautiful manner. Two times was the charm for me to be convinced that Mad Max deserved every single piece of acclamation it was getting. Director George Miller created the most engaging, fictional world with the right amount of action, with the perfect cast, and without never overloading the film with too many explosions or special effects.The main cast, Tom Hardy and (Who would have thought?!) Charlize Theron, are just phenomenal and work perfectly together. While the plot can easily speak on its own, this would've never worked without the right cast. It is impressive how they manage to make a mostly serious movie with extremely small hints of comedy here and there, entertaining and interesting.Now it is time to praise everything else. Sound and visual effects, production design, cinematography, costumes, makeup, and hair styling. Seriously. When I was talking about having an unexpected perfectly good balance I was not joking. The sound mixing and special effects are truly remarkable, bringing the movie to life and letting you in into the mayhem this world is. The costume, makeup and hair styling, hint at everything each character is, their personalities, and a glimpse at some back-story there is no time to tell within the two hours. And the cinematography directs you to what's important, and you are able to appreciate how involved each scene is.Mad Max is successful because it manages to turn an insane film, a chaotic film, into one of the best action movies that I have ever seen. Mind you, I am not big on action movies. It is not easy to control and shape this amount of chaos and confusion into a good film. At one point I had to ask myself, is this really an action movie? Because it is so freaking good. Mad Max is just incredibly good.",5
"  The best MM film and one of the finest, most intense action films in recent memory. Technically impeccable, with a fascinating soundtrack and photography, FR is also the best-written film of the series. Theron is very good in the role of Furiosa, but the most important asset is the unrelenting, frenzied, exhilarating and in some cases even moving action, be it big-scale chases or impressive fist fights. Brilliantly orchestrated by Miller and never running low on ideas, it's a triumph all-around.",4
"  My second favorite film of 2015, Mad Max Fury Road doesn't bog down with exposition, choosing instead to tell its story visually. And what a treat the visuals are, intense action and a startling attention to detail makes for a fantastic ride.",5
"  The only four words that i have said after the vision of ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" are ""George Miller is a genious"". This is the best movie of 2015's cinematografic season.Review from Italy.",5
  THIS WAS AMAZING!!!!! NO SHAKY CAM AND A GREAT PLOT!!!! I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!! I WATCHED THIS MOVIE 3 TIMES!!!!!! (probably will see more times),5
"  Top Movies of 2015 - #2What I never saw coming was the powerhouse that was Mad Max: Fury Road. From its exhilarating soundtrack, to his fantastic special effects (that don't abuse its CGI, and is in fact mostly practical, which adds a level of rawness) and its two amazing leads in Furiosa and Mad Max, this movie is definitely an action packed and explosive joy ride from beginning to end. There's so many cool moments in this movie, from the guitar flamethrower guy, to the spear throwing, self chroming war boys, and the ass-kicking Furiosa, this is the action genre at its finest.",5
"  What a film, what a lovely film!!!Set in a world where people had finally had enough of 30 indistinguishable superhero films every summer and decided to end it all, 'Fury Road' is a balls-to-the-wall, punk-rock masterpiece that offers an education in tone setting, cinematography, subtle characterisation and mind-blowing action to any would be spandex loving director.The film is a blistering high speed chase through the Australian outback that never once lets you catch your breath..... and that's really all it is....... except it isn't;You could count the number of lines of dialogue in this film on one hand and yet it still manages to fully flesh out every single character, we know who they are and what their motivation is, that is an astounding piece of storytelling. The setting for the film is beautiful and Miller masterfully shows us this wasteland rather than tells us about it, unlike a lot of summer blockbusters, this film remembers that cinema is a VISUAL storytelling medium. The action will have to go without saying because you just have to see it to believe it, I lack the vocabulary to truly explain what this film does with its action scenes.5 out of 5, I honestly can't say a single bad thing about it.",5
  One of my favorite movies of 2015 for sure. One of those movies you can watch multiple times and not get sick of.,5
"  I know several people who really dislike this movie, I'm guessing because it was hyped and lauded so much when it's a pretty dumb action flick. I went in thinking it was going to be another crappy reboot/remake/sequel and came out really surprised. Then I thought about it for awhile and went to see it twice more. It is a great action movie, a great exploitation/grindhouse film, and (I think) a modern classic. I don't like Tom Hardy, and I think he's great in the role of Max because he hardly talks. With the exception of the STUPID made-for-3D shot near the end (you know which one), this is one of the most fun films I've seen come out in years. Obviously, don't be expecting Lawrence of Arabia, here.",5
"  Thank god for Australian cinema, supplying the goods once again!",4
"  This movie is a visual masterpiece. The cinematography is outstanding. Producing a movie of this scale with all of the practical stunts and effects seems almost impossible. And that is why so many people are enamored with this movie. However the other half of the equation, the acting, writing and character development, are so bad that what could have been an epic classic ends up becoming a soulless action film with no substance to speak of. I wanted to love this film but it becomes very obvious that this was a ""sandbox"" for George Miller. 2 1/2 stars since it was half masterpiece and half... nothing.",2
"  Whats makes this movie special is that it is one of those rare movies which is not shot with Green Background, but on real locationWorth a watch !",5
"  One of the best movies of this generation. Its stunning visuals and sounds transcend this movie onto a whole new level. A great story with captivayting characters, Mad Max FR is a smash hit that will be remembered forever in movie histroy. The future of this franchise looks madly fanstatic.",5
  Mad MAX is driven by mindless action and riddled narrative which leads to an uncompelling story.,2
"  Tedious, a two hour car chase. Good special effects, but that is all.",1
  Enjoyed the movie but do not think it was as good as the original story lines. was pleased it did not try to be a remake of the first movie. would be interested in seeing more movies set in this period,4
"  The post apocalyptic aesthetics are on point, from the wasteland setting's color palette to the well designed costumes and props. The action-packed cinematography is high-energy excitement that puts many other action movies to shame. The storyline is enough to set the stage for all the high speed action sequences that are second to none.",4
"  Oh what a lovely movie, what a lovely movie! Let the huge amounts of action and explosions begin!",5
  Best movie of 2015 hands down,5
"  Pretty wild, hang on for the ride...",4
  By far the pinnacle of the series. 100% awesome.,5
"  A well-directed thrill ride that is paired with great performances and an Oscar-worthy score. While not a complex plot, this film immerses the audience in a world of absolute chaos, and leaves the audience begging for more.",5
"  Mad Max: Fury Road is a lot of fun to watch but I didn't think it was worth the 10 nominations that the film was up for including Best Picture. And I don't think the film should've won the 6 awards that it did like of course the film is fun to watch but its not a work of art. Other than that here are some positive aspects of the film Tom Hardy in my opinion was 100 times better than Mel Gibson even though Hardy barely talks throughout the film, however its Charlize Theron steals the show as Furiosa. In my opinion though I really enjoyed the character of Nux (Nicholas Hoult) I thought his character brought some necessary comedic relief through the film. Though Fury Road has some positive and negative aspects to the film its still a lot of fun to watch, but if you aren't fine with weird looking characters, car chases or heavy action sequences I don't recommend the film to you. However if you are fine with all that stuff then give it a try you might not be disappointed",4
"  I was never a fan of the original Mad Max, but I was surprised by Fury Road and how deep it actually was. The cinematography was stunning and amid the visuals there is a compelling story and characters you can't help but root for. Recommended.",4
"  Didn't think this movie would be anything, but it surprised me. Reviews are spot on, this is good. Violent and insanely faced paced, but flows really well and has depth.",4
  Very good next Mad Max chapter.,4
"  Don't want to seem like sour grapes, and taste is subjective, but my wife & I and 2 sons thought this was dire. Cartoon like action and little plot- and ludicrous at that. Certainly there was a lot going on but it all seemed pointless. I genuinely would have given 1&1/2 stars but don't want to drag the average down as so many people seemed to enjoy it. I can't believe the responses, normally critics pan actioners, while I can find some enjoyment in them, but this had nothing to redeem it in my eyes.",1
  What utter tripe. Totally over rated load of cobblers.,0
  not as good as I was expecting,4
  One of the worst films I've ever seen in the theaters.,1
  this moveir is absolute shit what a fucking waste of 2 hours of my life .. i cant believe i watched this shit it was only dur to the amount of wine i drank ..cunt bolloxs shite,1
"  This is a $150 million dollar science fiction art movie. Watch it with that in mind, but it is a ton of fun to watch. Amazing stunts, awesome design work, and a nice restrained use of CGI... Not that anything in this movie is restrained. This nuked out Australia has more life to it than in the past, and it looks like a surrealist's automotive nightmare. Max has always been a spectator to his own story in the fallout world set up in The Road Warrior. He is the last identifiable link to ""our"" human world. A guide we follow as he finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. This movie takes that idea to the extreme, and Max is just about the least important part of the movie. That's ok because this new Mad Max world is no place for ""normal"" humans.",5
"  I have to disagree with the ratings on this one. Didn´t like this one at all, too much car chasing, too much sand, lass fun. I even like the one with Tina Tuner more than this.",0
  How could it be anything less? A sodding adrenaline sodden masterpiece of non stop RARRRNESS!,5
"  OMG, i really wasn't expect it to be so good, but it really is , one of the Best Action Movies Ever, the make up, the sound, the design, everything.",5
"  rubbish, it was one big open road. No character development, attachment or structure. Feels like everyone liked it because they were meant to. Lacks substance",1
  The best movie of 2015. George Miller toke everything from an action and adventure movie and turned it into a masterpiece.,5
  Complete trash. Don't waste your time with this movie...,0
  Full adrenaline from the beginning to the end. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are badass.,4
"  Utilising the most amount of practical action seen in cinema for years, this expertly crafted piece of death and destruction makes every summer blockbuster today seem tame in comparison. I guess you could say they were all ""MEDIOCRE!""A",4
"  Not much of a story, but there doesn't need to be, this is a fun ride from start to finish.",4
  I walked out. so boring!,2
  george miller has created such a rich beautiful looking world which is vibrant and chaotic.. tom hardy takes over from mel gibson seamlessly the future is bright and wide open for this franchise.. can't wait for more!,5
"  For me, this was the film of the year!",5
  One of my favs of the year!,4
"  I didn't really care about this film when I went to the theatre, I've never been a big fan of post apocalyptic themes, but my feelings totally changed when I saw this beauty from George Miller. Hardy is great as Max, but Charlize Theron's Furiosa steals the show!",5
"  Best movie of 2015. Don't listen to the Oscars, BAFTAs or whatever. Fury Road is like a banquette for your eyes.",5
  No plot line or anything of interest... Just effects =[,0
"  Just not my kind of movie. I knew it wasn't when I saw the trailers, so I didn't see it in theaters. But after it won ALL the Oscars in 2016 (hyperbole, I know), I decided to give it a shot. It's technically beautiful, shot very well, and is one of the best examples of seamlessly marrying practical and visual effects to enhance what was filmed in camera. And the performances from Charlize Theron, Tom Hardy, and the rest of the supporting cast are very strong. But the over-the-top character design and some of the gloomier element of the story just aren't my bag.",2
  It's the closest thing to a perfect movie I've ever seen.,5
"  A cracking showdown of a post-apocalyptic premise and outstanding visuals wrapped with fun-fest of mayhem and absurdity.While at the same time showing lack of depth in the plot & few loose ends in the storyline.Nonetheless, it's uniqueness will amaze you & will take you to a different world. All in on, Mad Max: Fury Road is one hell of a ride.",4
  Wow didn't expect this to be that good,4
"  Can't wait, until I am amble to watch this film.",0
  Fantastic photography. A new standard has been set!,4
  more like a video game script than a movie,2
"  IN THE WORDS OF METAL HAMMER MAGAZINE THIS IS THE MOST METAL FILM OF THE YEAR......WOW.....WOW....SUCH AN ENJOYABLE MOVIE 2 WATCH WITH SUCH A FANTASTIC CAST THROUGHOUT THIS MOVIE IT IS SUCH A FANTASTIC MOVIE 2 WATCH WITH SUCH A BRILLIANT CAST THROUGHOUT THIS MOVIE......WARNING THIS MOVIE CONTAINS STROBE LIGHTNING EFFECTS THROUGHOUT SOME SCENES THROUGHOUT THIS MOVIE.......

  Grade: ARating: 9.5/10,4
  The cast in this film were amazing and George Miller never disappoints with his world of Mad Max; which is still relevant in the 21st century.,5
"  Here's the synopsis. Race across the desert being chased by bad guys only to find out where you were going isn't there, so go back from whence you came, kill all the rest of the bad guys, world peace restored. Two hours of my life I won't get back. This won Oscars for technical merit? I guess. #yawn",0
"  A symphony of exploding mayhem ! Solid acting, storytelling and visually engaging all the way to the end.",5
"  This is a total piece of cinematic waste. Such a stupid movie, an insult to intelligence, puerile, , a videodrome of special effects and ridiculously crafted machines. Leave your brain behind.",0
"  A nightmarish vision sure to blaze along the highways of Valhalla, shiny and chrome.",4
  A strange movie. I only watched it to see why people thought this was the best 2015 movie. But I wasn't impressed. I must be in the minority. It had tons of action but a strange movie with a lot of disturbing characters.,2
  great visuals. but it's overrated...,2
  What plot? Men ruin the world and Max is a blundering moron who ouldn't hold his own dick while pissing - enter balded Theron to get him through those hard parts. Haven't walked out of a film since matrix reloaded...,0
  I thought this was a very well made movie (and the Oscars agree) and the only thing wrong with it imo was that it was odd and confusing at times,4
  Good movie Mad max the best,0
"  There is a danger to Post Apocolyptic movies. The future is SO bleak, there is nothing to fight for, and therefore no tension. After about an hour and I gave up hope and fell asleep. Never has so much action made me sleep so soundly.",2
"  Tja, hier had ik toch heel wat meer van verwacht. Actie en nog eens actie (goed, maar vaak warrig) en een flinterdun verhaal.",2
"  One of the best uses of colour I've ever seen in film, and simply the most fully realized universe I've been sucked into in quite some years. Just an incredibly kinetic film, always moving, with wonderful performances. I know some people are lambasting the story, but I found it a relief to show a movie that presented a narrative without ever getting bogged down in exposition (there is definitely a narrative, simple as it may be). Part of me wishes it was just a smidge shorter, but overall definitely one of the most impressive blockbusters to come along in quite some time.",4
"  This is a very idiotic movie that fails in every respect: screenplay, casting, direction, editing. Retards who confuse pre-played video games with quality filmmaking apparently can't tell the difference between this and the original Road Warrior.",1
"  Destined to be a modern classic, Mad Max: Fury Road provides mind blowing and refreshingly sensational action sequences, but also has a strong narrative injecting some humanity into the film.",6
"  technically superb. imaginative setting and characters. but wow, what a drab story line. roles were grade-school shallow. acting wasn't required. over-the-top war carnage was hollywood trademarked, meaning of course, the heroes survive anything but dismemberment. in all, could have been just as impressive as a 15 minute film without wasting an hour plus of one's life.",1
  This movie was terrible why do people like it?,0
  I wasn't expecting to like this one bit as I hated the original. Greatly surprised- action from start to finish and I couldn't get enough.,4
"  This film makes it clear that the Oscar committee, as well as the Rotten Tomatoes critics, can be bought. This is literally the worst movie I have ever seen. It makes Waterworld look like the Godfather. It made ""Jason X"" look like ""Shindler's List."" I might actually be dumber for having watched this movie. I only finished it all the way through because of how hilariously bad it was, which allowed me to put on my own ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" right in my very own home.I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who enjoys satiring terrible films that lack any substance or depth.",0
  wow. Movie kicks ass!,5
  Just because a film is filled with explosions doesn't mean it is the best action film ever. Pretty good film though. Barely any Max in it though.,4
"  The film is a visual roller coaster, thanks to the extreme creative genius of the technical crew in crafting a stimulating feast for the eyes that the characters inhabit throughout this post-apocalyptic story. However, it is the story that is the personal drawback for me in the movie, with my failure to become invested enough in the characters or, at times it seemed, the thinly-stretched story across the two-hour runtime. Nevertheless, George Miller brings a refreshing invigoration to his directing that is extremely admirable and impressive.",4
"  Visually compelling, great action, but missing a story. This action packed, extraordinarily filmed movie is a bit of a guilty pleasure, but if you are looking for any resemblance of a coherent plot line, then you will want to pass this one up. I couldn't believe this was nominated for best picture. I will add that the Oscars won by this picture were well deserved; film editing- check, to make what little story line out of the little actual plot line equals Oscar to me. I saw this movie in 3D which added to the impact of the non-stop action, which makes this a must see for teen age boys who can talk their mom and dad into letting them watch an R rated movie. If you are looking for something with a story that will peak your intellect, pass this up; if you want nonsensical action without a cohesive plot, this is may be for you.",1
"  George Miller arriesga el todo por el todo al traer de regreso la violencia grÃÂ¡fica al cine de verano, con una obra maestra visual que tiene a Charlize Theron a la cabeza de una trama que a la vista parece formulÃÂ¡ica, pero que esconde muchos subcontextos para convertir a Fury Road en una de las mejores pelÃÂ­culas de la dÃÂ (C)cada.",5
"  loved this movie, wish max would have played a bigger role",4
"  Awesome animation, altogether a nice movie",4
  Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron...non stop action!,4
"  Horroble, boring movie",1
"  A masterclass of film making. This is an action film with the right blend of carefully handled character development. You are left to draw on your knowledge of Mad Max and his world to figure out how things stand. It doesn't lack for story at all - it simply doesn't spoonfeed you. I watched this a second time with my friend at the biggest IMAX in Europe, and I can safely say that it changed my outlook on action movies.So interesting to see the cyclical inspiration of Max Max > Borderlands > Mad Max too!",5
"  Visually stunning, grande and so over the top it's great.",4
"  The best movie of 2015!!!The cinematography, picture and the theme behind it makes this the best movie by George Miller",5
"  Mad Max Fury Road was one of those rare action films which will leave a lasting impression in any movie goers mind. I still remember flocking into the IMAX theatre for the very first time in my life in Bangalore. The screen was much bigger and clear in comparison to other theatre. But then, you cant really attribute all the amazement to the environment. I'd say that this day was memorable only because of me being able to witness a film which would mark its place in cinematic history as one of the finest action movies of ALL time. George Millers vision is so captivating that the moment we see the brown sand simmering in the screen, we know what this planet would be like in decades to come. As the film progresses, I kept wondering that how well were the scenes choreographed, the action set pieces , characters, make ups et cetera. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron acted well and played their part with absolute perfection but the real surprise to me was Nicolas Hoult. He was a show stealer in some of the scenes. Especially the last one, wherein he rams the CAR at Rictus and mentions ""Witness Me""",5
"  Nice movie! It reflect the pollution problems on earth, and nice stun scene!",4
"  This film is a well executed, thrill-ride, that is short on dialogue, but not on substance. Love it so much. The characters and images are unforgettable.",5
"  Cruising on a proverbial wave of hype, Mad Max: Fury Road is the first time Mr. Rockatansky has graced our screens since 1985, and it certainly is a thunderous return for the series. Rarely have chase scenes been so exciting, rarely have landscapes looked so gorgeous, and rarely has a colour palette been so varied and striking. By opting to stage practical action sequences with stunt drivers and real vehicles instead of CGI and computer simulations, not only does the action feel more kinetic, it also feels more human. We're seeing real people doing real driving and taking real risks. As it was with the Indiana Jones trilogy, it gives everything a more authentic feel, and proves that special effects are no substitute for human involvement.With all that said, the story in the movie is where a lot is left to be desired. The characters, while underdeveloped, do interact and co-operate in a believable way, united in the universal quest for survival and freedom, but all of them exist in something of a narrative vacuum. The entire thing is more or less a 2-hour car chase, and while all of these sequences are executed beautifully, they don't really serve a higher purpose. I definitely wouldn't hail it as the best of the series, as many other viewers have done. The political commentary is familiar to anyone who has seen the other MM movies, and Max is, as he was in the second film, relegated to a supporting performance in his own film. But with all that instalment, if you're in it for the action, this movie delivers like no other in recent memory. It could do with being a fair bit meatier, but for the adrenaline junky in all of us, it's more than enough to satisfy our appetites.",4
  A very well made 2 hour long music video...hardly any dialogue or plot...I was so bored didn't make it through the whole thing...I'm glad it didn't get more than technical Oscars.,2
"  The movie had hardly any plot for the first half of the movie. The rest of it wasn't that great either. I liked the original Mad Max movies, but this one just wasn't that great. Stunned that it won awards.",1
  Holy mother of GOD!!! Everything else just became MEDIOCRE!!!!,5
  It was wild and boolin,5
  Absolutely the best film of 2015. The whole thing was masterfully put together. The action was stunning and brutal. You really did have a feeling that this kind of world was possible too. Maybe not to the extent of the madness that we saw in this but the base of the world seemed very real. The 6 Oscars were very well deserved.,4
  Una locura con sentido. Acción y locura de principio a fin. Tremendos efectos especiales. Muy buena en general.,4
"  george miller .. oh my god ..... another masterpiece , great effects , great actors .. great storyline ... 10/10",5
"  Strong, really strong, stuning, ridiculous but is all you might want from and action movie and even more. The Fury Road is open!",4
  This is the most overrated film I have ever seen. Sure the visuals are amazing but that doesn't make up for an overall crappy movie.,0
"  George Miller has yet again created another sci-fi/action masterpiece just as he did in 1979 with the very first Mad Max film. the directing is absolutely phenomenal and he brings his own franchise back to a vivid reinvigorating fresh insurgence. this is truly one of the best action films I have ever seen in my life. it never lets up at any moment throughout the entire film and I was in a energetic buzz like mode throughout. while also being all of that, it has a surprising narrative depth to it in its view of the apocalypse coming to our world. Charlize Theron is a complete bad ass as Imperator Furiosa and Tom Hardy is great as Max. while the title of the movie may be Mad Max this is most definitely Furiosa's movie. Theron commands the screen every scene she's in and truly makes it feel like it's her own movie. Fury Road is a thrilling, energetic, action packed modern masterpiece that will go down as one of the best action films ever made and a fine example of how to bring a franchise back from the dead the right way and make it absolutely stunning.",5
"  I'm not a fan of the Mad Max franchise, but ""Fury Road"" was excellent! ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" has a decent story (albeit with plot holes aplenty) and interesting characters with marvelous costume, makeup and special effects. It's truly spectacular.",6
"  It wasnt bad. I wish the end was more satisfying. I have some gripes about it for sure, and despite what just about everyone said, I do think it helps to have seen the originals.",2
  Most WTF movie of 2015.,2
  One of the best movies I have ever seen in my life,5
"  Mad Max: Fury Road is a continuation of the previous Mad Maxes and I thought this was pretty darn good. Watching this Mad Max you're sitting there going like, what am I witnessing? If you have never seen a Mad Max before that will be your reaction. Everything about the Mad Max universe is so different and special Bringing back Miller was the by far the best decision.Without him this movie would not have been anything close to what is was. Miller makes the movie feel like an original Mad Max film. From the weird skull guys, bad ass cars, and post apocalyptic wasteland, A great thing about Mad Max are the characters. Charlize Theron plays Furiosa, a girl who has stolen precious cargo from main villain, Immortan Joe, that all of his followers are after. Charlize Theron as Furiosa was the highlight of the movie. She is the most interesting and most impactful than any other character on screen. Fury Road is the ultimate thrill ride and definition of a good action movie. The action sequences and visual effects are so beautiful and amazing. Every shot is as real as it gets and looks spectacular. Definitely one of the best looking films of the year. The movie is so alive and bright that it makes it hard to keep your eyes off the screen because you don't want to miss anything. My biggest flaw in Mad Max is sadly Tom Hardy's portrayal of Max. I didn't feel his performance was strong enough or energetic like the character should be. But I overall I loved Fury Road. It's action scenes were amazing, awesome characters, and extremely well directed. Should be a fun watch for any Mad Max or action movie fan.",4
  A fast paced delight.,5
"  Very entertaining and action packed, the stunts and vissuals are top notch",4
  Wowsa! So well done.,4
  great movie from start to finish. there is never a dull moment. this is a movie you can watch many times and still get entertained each time.,5
"  Excellent acting and suspense, Mad Max is great showcase of action, Charlize Theron and practical effects.",5
  Eh. I still think The Road Warrior was the best one,2
"  After watching Mad Max, I felt I had been on a 30 mile forced march. It's action packed, sometimes silly, but I think it deserved most of the awards it won. It was a creative masterpiece.",4
"  While I can't say I loved this movie like everyone else did, this is still a remarkably crafted film into this young boys change in life and understanding of who he is. What I really like about is it feels like a genuine personal story about a young man living the harsh realities in a rough urban neighborhood. It is very well crafted and every actor in this movie does a great job at playing their roles.",4
  This is an example of how the deviation state of man can be shown as a healthy state of man. Sick ideology is doing surgery on people brains through the culture. This is neo-Marxism called Gender.,0
  Poignant and beautiful in every aspect. The score is breathtaking and the cinematography is by far the best I have ever seen. Please watch Moonlight!!!,5
"  The poster containing all three faces of the actors playing the main character with a pink triangle approaches perfection. Barry Jenkins' screenplay is in three sections. Alex R. Hibbert plays Little in the first. When the character grows up a bit and goes by his given name Chiron he is played by Ashton Sanders. Then after time in prison he has hardened himself and is called Black, played by Trevante Rhodes. In all three sections Chiron struggles with being gay and having feelings for his friend Kevin. Chiron also has a difficult time caring for his mother (Naomie Harris) who is addicted to drugs. When he was little at least he experienced love when another couple temporarily took him in. Janelle Monáe and Mahershala Ali play this couple. This film deserved its eight Oscar nominations (and three of those became wins). It is set to a slower poetic pace that lingers on the inner turmoil and desires of its protagonist.",6
"  After watched it I said me ""What a great movie that has touched many hearts... I want more movies like this!"" and.... what's happened then? I met my best friend and he said me that he use boxxy software, it is for free and he can find all movies want in a great quality... I was shoked... Really... Then I try it and it's true! It's amazing software the same as this amazing movie!After watched it I said me ""What a great movie that has touched many hearts... I want more movies like this!"" and.... what's happened then?

  One of the best movies I'Ve Ever Seen. Not what I expected.,5
"  Moonlight came out in November of 2016 and went on to win the Academy Award for best picture that year. This movie is directed by Barry Jenkins and stars a pretty solid cast, namely Naomie Harries, Janelle Monae and Madershala Ali. The movie is split into three acts and follows a young boy named Chirone and his struggles with his own identity. First things first this film has brilliant direction and it includes some all around standout performances. However, this is a movie that conflicts my own judgement and view on film and entertainment because I felt many different ways about this movie after viewing it. All around this movie is really well done. A masterfully told story with some incredible drama and some truly touching scenes. On the other hand this movie has moments where it really really slows up and doesn't quite drag on but.. it just doesn't really do anything. In that I mean this is a very realistic take on a truly touching story so in that there will be some moments that are sometimes mundane. Moonlight is a film that has stuck with me since my first time watching it and I do think about this film from time to time so it has done a good job at leaving an impact. As previously stated this film is cut into three acts and each actor that plays Chirone does a remarkable job. This movie also has some great shots and really good looking scenes. In that the cinematography is great! Moonlight is a slow burn and a very touching take on a very real story. I applaud the filmmakers for staying true to the art and making a well told story but I cannot deny the fact that this movie could've been a bit of a better watch with 15 minutes shaved off. Moonlight is a 4/5 for me!",4
"  Definitely one of the must-see American movies 2016.Beautifully directed, with clear, yet understated point of view.",5
"  Was a great drama in which followed and unfolded the events of a young African american man having to deal with a drug addicted mother, and a post modern cruel reflective world filled with bully's and people who criticize you for being gay.Their was a scene where 2 guys get intimate so be cautious if watching with your parents.Other then that it was a very self reflecting film and helps to show how good you may have it compared to some children/people.",4
"  Barry Jenkins, screenwriter and director of the adaptation of ""Moonlight,"" is the most recent Hollywood darling after releasing the most authentic film of 2016, portraying a side of black society rarely seen, even when it's in the backdrop of what most would imagine urban black living is like. The bold and intense movie about a boy split into showing three phases of his life is based on an intriguing story based in Miami over the past 25 or so years. It isn't, unfortunately, hard to imagine a black youth in Reagan America living in the projects without a father, living only with his crack-addicted mother, that is when she is around, and attempting as best as he can to get through school and life. What isn't common to see, however, is how said boy befriends the very drug dealer who is supplying his mother's habit and somehow becomes a part-time family with he and his girlfriend. And it isn't common to see the hard life and confusion within the young boy manifest itself into sexual introspection and the development of a spine to defend himself against bullies eager to mock his preference and social situation. The path young Chiron travels is one no one would want to follow, but some have to travel anyway. The viewer can't help but be affected by the brutal realism of his situation. The acting in this movie, specifically by the three actors who portray Chiron through life, can hardly be beat this year, but the movie isn't perfect and, thus, shouldn't win Best Picture, even though Vegas odds have it very close to the movie that should, ""La La Land."" The story has its choppy moments and ends rather abruptly, though it comes to resolution. I can't say where else I would have wanted the story to go and, frankly, it might have been too Hollywood if it did, but the end came suddenly for me and ended with a sweet whimper. Not to take away its importance in theme, but a perfect film, or Best Picture, it is not.",4
"  Extremely slow, boring and goes nowhere. I kept waiting for it to get better. It never did. $1.50 Redbox rental. Not worth it and it's 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back.",0
  Hollywood loves films that touch on LGBT (I use touch lightly); mix that with a Hood story; throw in some protests; some trump and you got yourself an Academy film and supporting actor winner.,0
"  Shocking, yet beautiful.",4
"  Emotive piece, excellent music. The starkness and acting stand out.",5
  Tremendous insight into real life among the unloved and disadvantaged.,5
  Wished a lot more would have been said.,4
"  When you go to the cinema today, you will see a trove of blockbusters, full of action and CGI. The films we consider the best of our time almost always have something to do with the level of CGI and fanciness put in through the post-production process. These movies are nearly always given either a standing ovation for the extremeness of it all or a dismissal due to over-the-top CGI. Barry Jenkins' one-of-a-kind beauty Moonlight has little to no CGI and tells a human story, rather than a superhuman story. The characters are not two-dimensional, quite the opposite. The main character's mother, Paula (played by the brilliant Naomie Harris) is an excellent example. Paula is negligent (and in some parts of the film, truly hostile) to her son, as well as being a Crack addict. But she still loves her son. The level of detail and raw emotion of the characters are the driving force of this film. The cinematography is excellent without becoming a distraction and helps enforce the story's power. Nicholas Britell's soundtrack for the film is amazing and only adds to the film. This film was truly amazing, and it deserves every award it received. A wonder like this only comes around once in a while.",5
  A fantastic and uniquely told story that in encapsulating and original with an amazing and peaceful score.,5
  Great stuff... made me feel like I do when I've fallen in love.... That scene at the jukebox...!,0
"  Adiei por um ano esse filme pensando que seria mais um drama qualquer sobre um jovem negro em um bairro pobre americano, e ainda bem que eu não poderia estar mais enganado. Fui agraciado com um dos filmes mais tocantes e sensíveis, de uma beleza única e que foge de todos os padrões de produções da mesma temática.O primeiro aspecto que não poderia deixar de comentar são as atuações, e que escolha de casting perfeita, todos os atores entregam performances dignas de Oscar, não a toa que Naomie Harris e Mahershala Ali foram indicados e um deles até levou a estatueta pra casa. Naomie nos entrega um atuação tão real em uma personagem detestável, que percebemos o estudo e a entrega dela à sua atuação, retratando fielmente uma mulher perdida que não sabe como ajudar e reagir as escolhas do filho os mesmo tempo que luta contra seu vicio as drogas. Ali por outro lado, mesmo que na pele de um homem que era pra ser deplorável nos mostra um lado paternal e carinhoso que pode estar presente em qualquer um e somente é necessário uma oportunidade para demonstrar tais sentimentos guardados.Mas os três atores que foram escolhidos para interpretar Chiron durante os três atos do filme dão um show a parte, criando um senso de coesão entre suas atuações realmente passando a sensação que as consequências das ações e decisões enquanto criança refletem em sua fase adulta, a dor e desamparo no olhar e até mesmo sua postura são diferentes em cada parte do filme e ao mesmo tempo são uma só, completando umas as outras.Além das atuações impecáveis, o longa ainda conta com uma direção incrível com cenários e cores deslumbrantes, com um ótimo trabalho de iluminação e pós-produção fazendo cada ato do filme ser completamente diferente do anterior com cada vez mais cores saturadas e azuladas e que dizem muito sobre a situação emocional do protagonista e do seu ambiente. A montagem do filme é milimetricamente calculada, com todas as cenas passando alguma mensagem, nada é em vão nesse filme.O único defeito para mim foi simplesmente o fato de faltar mais, eu queria mais do filme, algumas situações e explicações para alguns acontecimentos teriam me dado uma experiencia mais gratificante mesmo eu entendendo o que o filme queria dizer e onde ele queria chegar. Além de uma ou duas cenas que julguei desnecessárias ou sem algum significado real para a trama.O filme é brilhante e não deve ser perdido por nada, poucas vezes vi algo tão visceral e belo na tela, Moonlight é um exercício para reflexão e para quebras de expectativas e paradigmas que consideramos como certos.",4
"  Hands down, one of my all time favorite films! So glad it won Best Picture! Beautiful and stunning film.",5
"  Well-written, -acted, -directed, and -scored, this is about as close as you're gonna get to a perfect independent film that is heavily character driven. These performances will stick with you long after you leave the theater. A classic American film.",5
"  Barry Jenkins' Moonlight is the absolute best film of 2016 from a year filled with incredible pieces of visual art. It is easily one of my all time favorite films. Moonlight captures the shy emotions of a young black man from Florida named Chiron. Moonlight is a beautiful testament to true love that spans decades. Homosexuality is an often ignored, tormented, and repressed demographic within black communities, so Moonlight is a breath of fresh air for an entire group of people. It handles a difficult subject with a subtle grace and care not regularly afforded to LGBT persons. Moonlight proudly and lovingly demonstrates how people may hide or not understand how they feel about sex and that is alright. It is a powerful message that transcends any particular sexuality, so that all audiences everywhere can empathize and relate. Moonlight is glorious.We see him struggle to accept his sexuality as a homosexual male in the black community over 3 stages of his life. From a shy boy called Little that must survive bullies, poverty, and his negligent crack addicted mother. Chiron grows into an abused teenager seeking some kindness. Finally, Chiron matures into an adult man going by the name Black that has grown hard by his environment, the trap scene, and the prison industrial complex.The acting within Moonlight is phenomenal! Every performance is captivating. All 3 actors that play Chiron including: Alex R. Hibbert, Ashton Sanders, as well as Trevante Rhodes enthrall you the entire movie's duration. Each actor leaves an impression of deep compassion, profound hurt, and an untouched longing. Whether it is in their respective pained words or unspoken body language, these gentlemen exude their own unique take on playing timid. To portray a single person in withdrawn pain takes acting skill. Hibbert, Sanders, and Rhodes are sublime separately, while simultaneously projecting a reserved radiance. They each relate to the other performances with their eye and body movements in such a subtle way you might miss it. I look forward to seeing Trevante Rhodes in more movies after Moonlight. He has a wide emotional range that impressed me greatly.The supporting cast is superb all around. Mahershala Ali is the perfect complex father figure. He is a caring drug dealer that is clearly trying to uplift his community while he is also a cause of its suffering. He is so sweet and smart, you will wish Ali was your father by the end. Mahershala Ali as Blue is the greatest on screen portrayal of a black father figure since Laurence Fishburne as Furious Styles in John Singleton's legendary coming of age classic Boyz n the Hood. Ali deserved his Best Support Actor Oscar as he emanates charm, decency, and kindness. Remember the name Mahershala Ali!André Holland is so expressive as the adult Kevin. You can see how his character feels just by looking into his revealing eyes. I cannot write a review for Moonlight without mentioning Janelle Monáe's performance as the kindly Teresa. She is the sweetest character in Moonlight and absolutely charming. She embodies the spirit of motherhood. Naomie Harris is terrific as Chiron's strung out mother Paula. She is horrifying cruel, yet still empathetic by the end. You feel pity for her. Harris captures the intricate nature of Paula and how nuanced motherhood is in Moonlight.Director Barry Jenkins is a genius. I must say Moonlight is one of the best filmed movies I have ever seen. The panning shots are so engaging. His choices for the inserts for the passage of time are endearing. Jenkins gets it all right with Moonlight. The cinematography cannot be overstated. It is gorgeous every second. Characters will be in focus in the foreground as the world disappears out of focus in the background. Jenkins has already proven he is a formidable mind behind the camera. His direction is innovative on a technical level, but also so appealing in a visual sense. Barry Jenkins is a director to watch for in the foreseeable future.I must mention that Moonlight has the most lovely lighting from any film I can mention. It's bright and clear throughout. You will be taken aback by the color scheme as well. Red for instigators, blue for kindness, white for safety, and black for a harsh reality. It's a genius use of color as every single scene utilizes Barry Jenkins' thoughtful color palette. Musically, Moonlight shines with a wholly unique blend of classical cues and hip hop selections carefully chosen to best represent each scene sonically. Barry Jenkins knows how to pick them as Moonlight boasts killer rap classics from Goodie Mob to Kendrick Lamar remixes. The quieter moments are gently cradled by lush string arrangements and nestled right into your heart with a delicate elegance. It is worth listening to Moonlight's soundtrack and score on their own. You have never heard a combination of classic and contemporary harmonized for optimal atmosphere. Moonlight can claim its place in the hallowed halls of the fine film legacy of LGBT pictures like Blue Is the Warmest Color, Call Me by Your Name, Carol, A Single Man, and more recently, Love, Simon or Disobedience. Moonlight will only age well as its maturity, nuance, grace, humanity, and empathy are only paralleled by its technical prowess. Barry Jenkins deserved all the praise and accolades he has received for Moonlight. Moonlight earned that Best Picture Oscar.Do yourself a favor: watch and be moved by Moonlight.",5
  Compelling and supremely well acted. Stays with you,5
"  A movie is more than a movieMOONLIGHTHum... it's always ungrateful for someone to write about something they don't quite understand. This week I've watched Renoir, Goddard and now Jenkins and I left each movie knowing less about film as I did walking in (though I despise Goddard). In all truth, a good movie should challenge what you believe and question your perception. So it's always emotionally tasking to rate a film that rings so personal to you, as when you critique it, you can't help to pick it apart. Moonlight is a coming of age story shot perfectly, this is where you see a director's vision coming through. As we follow Chiron as he goes from little to grown up we understand gradually more about his mind and personality. We see, before our eyes, the character evolving and changing in ways that Boyhood never quite acomplishes, for example. Chiron is played beautiful by the three actors who have equal meritt in portraying him in a way we don't stop feeling his essence. Future Oscar winner Mahershela Ali is a knock out alongside Janelle Monae but enough praise can't be given to Naomie Harris who, after the crapfest Collateral Beauty, gives a complex and enthralling portrayal of a drug adict. The soundtrack is one of the most perfect (if not the most) of the year, it grips you, haunts you and it complements the movie with grace. The cinematography is a perfect fit for Jenkin's direction - with expressive use of depth of focus and and the shifting of focal points beyond what's obvious. Also, the use of color cannot be understated, with one of the best deliveries of color mainly through light cinema has ever seen. The only thing I'd rule against is its overuse of flares, which is a matter of personal taste more than anything. Overall, the cinematography is a extremely lenghty home run, Jekins can make wiping jizz in the sand seem beautiful. Structurally is flawless and its editing and script are two feats of filmmaking. I'd argue that it looses steam in the third act and the end could have been worked on, yet I can't say many more cons. In the end, the subject matter hit me hard as I could see myself in many ways in Chiron. Watching him try to come to terms with his homossexuality and being bullied are things that didn't happen to me but could easily have. Most moments in first two acts seem like a succession of blows that brought me to tears and caused me to be on the edge of my seat. I don't remeber a recent time when I rooted so much for a character. It's a heartrenching movie that all should see. It's these kind of films that the Academy should recognize! This film is why I go to the movies!",4

"  Moonlight is a modern masterpiece. The story may seem simple and familiar, but it is told in an extremely powerful way, addressing themes like masculinity, identity, love, race, class, and parenting, all told in a visceral way that makes the setting come to life through the eyes of the highly relatable outsider. I have no complaints about this film as I still can't get it out of my head. There is and has never been anything like Moonlight.",5
"  Little, Chiron, Black.",5
"  Haunting, beautiful, perfect",5
  The critics are right on this one; you should watch it.,5
  Could not even finish watching this film. Casting for the adult Chiron was terrible...they not even the same body type as young Chiron! Took me a while to figure out what was happening. All the critics must be drinking something funny to think this film has any merits at all. Does a lot of damage for the black image.,1
  It's not an enjoyable movie. Not because it's bad. Because it's so real and too deep. A flawless movie that definitely isn't for everyone.,5
"  THE BEST FILM OF 2016! A coming-of-age piece that tells its main character's compelling life-story with three defining chapters of his life, and does so with spellbinding passion.",5
  Praised by colleagues I gave it a try but found it unrelatable and kind of a stretch on reality,1
"  Beautiful, sensitive and sad. I think it's a masterpiece.",4
"  Brilliant cinematography, loved everything about this film..",4
"  To start off, I just want to say that this is my favourite movie of all times. After watching it for the fourth time, I feel the need to really analyse this movie with everyone and try to understand the importance of this movie. This movie largely talks about Black Masculinity and the dealing of homosexuality around a homophobic environment.I. Little: Starting off the movie with one of the key issues within Chiron's life, his mothers addiction to heroin. After running into the abandoned house, he finds a crack pipe on the floor, it is also the starting point of when Little finds out about what his mother is dealing with and what an impact its having on his life. Juan meets him within that same house, breaking loose the wood panels over the windows, uncovered by light almost as his guardian. While eating lunch, it seems as if Chiron receives his first apology from someone, after he looks up at Juan after giving back his food. Even during his playtime, he stands there looking at other boys play and it is a simile of how some gay people might feel, he stands there feeling like he's from the outside looking in, outside the box and not really fitting in within a category of people that he have met before. The sheer attention to detail that has been given by Barry Jenkins is incredible, and props to the cinematographer as well for their beautiful imagery that they have portrayed here. The music of course is also worth a mention, as this piano work has stuck with me and other vintage records pulled up here clicked right into place. Within the first chapter you can see his first steps into strengthening of character. From Juan he receives his first male support and starts feeling more safe, when letting go in the water. He only manages to let go when everyone else around him are free, during dance, you can truly see his feeling of freedom for that split moment. Actors within each role have played SUCH a strong part and would not change them for anyone else. Really it was so impressive and so touching. Even within the first chapter you can notice some bullying but it gets more intense during his teenage years in chapter II.II. Chiron: You can notice his struggle to talk about heterosexuality when his only friend Kevin starts speaking to him, he is just lost for words and not necessarily comfortable with the subject. He carries his confined personality through his life as a means for people to not be able to see him for what he really is. It is very saddening but true what you see on the screen of the stress of a child, seeing what his mother is going through and being completely helpless. After going through a tough period, that is what the chapter ends with, enough is enough and Chiron tries to deal with his bullies.III. Black: Within this chapter you can see the re-occurring theme of what happened in the end of chapter II, where he likes to feel the cold, dipping his face into an ice filled sink. In this chapter you can see the 'new him' not necessarily the 'real him'. He has created this persona based on his mentor Juan, replicating his style, car, lifestyle and even the crown on the dashboard of his vehicle. After receiving a call from Kevin, that is when his breakthrough of the thug characters takes place, finally being touched by someone emotionally. After walking into the cafe, you can really tell the difference in mood and lighting, the unfolding of CHIRON really takes place. Even while speaking to Kevin and being confronted with 'This is not you' he responds in a negative way, being scared to open up, after building this strong character for so long. Kevin continues to perform his embarrassed head shake that he does after making an embarrassing joke. His reflection of past can even be noticed on his car, when he drives off with the licence plate reading 'BLACK035'. When they arrive, he feels the breeze of the waters. He gets questions 'Who is you?' and that's when Chiron really needs to let his feelings out. Ending the movie, them finally being re-united again, the image of Little being back by the water communicates his feeling of Peace, feeling like he is back to what he always felt IS him.",5
"  Definitely better than La La Land. Mahershala Ali did a lot less than I expected given all the awards, but I?m surprised it didn?t pick up the Oscar for directing, or at the very least, cinematography, which was beautiful and striking and pretty stunning throughout.",4
  Horrible. Terrible. Nothing to like about it.,0
"  Awful movie, and I don't find many that I call awful. Just because a movie wins awards does not mean it is good. And that's the case here. I asked for my money back and have never done that",0
"  Beautifully crafted almost to poignantly real, stunningly shot with precise and wondrous editing, and heartbreaking acting from the entire cast (including Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris) prove that Barry Jenkins has created one of the most beautiful films of the year flawlessly.",5
  This is the worst movie I have ever seen.,0
"  A haunting film that stays with you, long after you leave the cinema.",5
"  Fantastically directed and beautifully shot with a striking use of colour and music, 'Moonlight' is one of those rare films that captures the essence of something special, relating its tale in a way that casts a spell on its audience. Following the life of someone who is seen to be a little different, we see him go from a boy to a man and how his experiences, the good and the bad, have shaped him. Outstanding performances from all involved rounds things off, making this an incredibly engaging film in more ways than one, giving us an insight into the lives of those who are not often seen on the silver screen.",4
"  A wonderful film - there was so much to it. The colours, the music and the brilliant acting. Mrs B hated it.",5
  Moonlight is one of the heart touching movies I have ever seen. Its simple and beautifully written.,5
"  4 out of 5 stars! This was a very good and powerful film! I can see why it won best film at the Oscars last year. Good acting, good writing, good cinematographer, and important messages conveyed throughout.",4
"  As tender as it is tough as it is true, three-tiered coming-of-age drama Moonlight is a near-master class character study that almost reaches the vaunted heights of its A+ reputation. In this R-rated Oscar winner, director Barry Jenkins chronicles the childhood, adolescence and burgeoning adulthood of a young, African-American, gay man growing up in a rough neighborhood of Miami. Truly, in any other year or awards cycle, this film might have found itself in the also-ran category. Given the backlash surrounding the 'Oscars So White' brouhaha, however (in which the Motion Picture Academy of Arts & Sciences barely put forth any African-American nominees), this independent gem improbably claimed the year's top prize. To say that Academy voters gave Moonlight the Best Picture trophy due to white guilt or a self-back-patting PR-move truly undermines a beautifully acted and shot achievement in filmmaking. However, the truth is that Moonlight is good but not THAT good. Weighing the film with these heaviest of laurels only serves to put an albatross around its neck, dashing expectations along the way and undermining its beauty in another way. At times heart-tugging and heart-wrenching (sometimes at the same time), there are many things to love about Moonlight, beginning with its source. The film takes its inspiration from In the Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue, an unpublished play by Tarell Alvin McRaney, in more ways than one. Beyond the title and narrative, there is also the matter of color. Almost everything - from the rolling surf where a fatherly drug dealer takes young Chiron for his first ocean dip to the clothes worn by a teenage Chiron's abusive mother to the streetlights of nighttime Miami where a hardened adult-aged Chiron peddles narcotics - exudes an almost ethereal blueish hue. And that's the splendor of Jenkins and cinematographer James Laxton's unified vision. Life is not simply black and white; it's black and blue--dark moments punctuated by color. Just look at the film's poster, which showcases the three faces of Chiron as one in stark black and blue. The vicious visceral sense of the term 'black and blue' in regards to bruising only compounds this notion. Notice too that these aforementioned scenes also bely this duality. In these highlighted moments, there's the hurtful but loving mother, the kind-hearted but socially despicable father figure and our protagonist, a lost little boy grown into a callous criminal. There are colorful qualities to these often-dark lives, which is definitely an authentically human quality. Thankfully, Jenkins and Laxton capture this all in a truly cinematic fashion, forgoing handheld in lieu of a good old-fashioned stationary camera. It exudes beauty in tragedy, providing the perfect backdrop as a man slowly finds himself. Alex Hibbert (Little), Ashton Sanders (Middle), and Trevante Rhodes (Big) play three versions of this same person but, together though separate, awesomely and seamlessly provide one solid and wholly believable through-line. They ARE Chiron. With little screen time, their co-stars, Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris, both leave a lasting impact felt long after the final credit has rolled. Ali, so ridiculously deserving of his Oscar win for Best Supporting Actor, grounds an unlawful dealer named Juan who, alternatively, has a moral center so strong that he takes a neglected child under his caring wing. Together, Chiron and Juan truly challenge the issue of masculine identity. Again, there is that duality.Speaking of duality, there are some slight cons. Even with all of its pluses, Moonlight has somewhat limited appeal. If you strip away the visuals (just for argument's sake, mind you), this story has already been seen and heard countless times by audiences. While it beautifully presents a real-feeling coming-of-age story, not a lot actually happens. Despite the presence of guns, drugs and thugs, it is a quiet film without a discernible plot or target audience. This is not to say that it's boring or that these are deal-breakers...at least for some audiences. Indeed, if filmgoers allow themselves to get caught up in the trappings of this story, it will move them--not overwhelmingly so but moving nonetheless. One has to truly be willing to immerse themselves in these blue waters, however, and this experience rarely exhibits a 'wow' moment. Sadly, to many, Moonlight will feel like a slow-moving lesson in monotony. To Sum it Up: Walk Into the Light",5
  To be honest it's overrated. It's all political. Love the score though,1
  Some great cinematography takes you through the emotional life of a young man.,4
"  I'm sorry but this is not worthy of an Oscar let alone best picture. Slow, boring and uninteresting. I'm not being harsh this film does not stand up to others that have achieved its accolades, not even close.",2

  Incredible Character Development. Full Of Heartfelt Moments. One Of The Most Effective Coming Out Conversations I Have Ever Seen On Screen.,4
"  Overall, I enjoyed the movie because of the quality acting portrayed. Infact the acting was so amazing that I felt connected with certain characters like Chiron. During the more intense scenes, I hated certain characters and wanted to physically punch them. My only complaint is the ending because I wanted to see some romance between Chiron and Kevin.",5
  Great movie with great characters. You really get drawn in to their lives. Def makes you think about life from different angles. This movie made me feel uncomfortable and angry. I am not as forgiving. I wanted revenge.,4
  It really brought me back to when I was young growing up in the inner city. And see the subject of sexuality in the black community as a white person is really interesting knowing the taboo of homosexuality. Film with character who had many layers. I recommend to anyone and everybody.,5
"  I was apprehensive that this might be a blatant tearjerker or poverty safari, but it was neither, though still shocking and moving. A beautiful and dreamlike film, with extraordinarily deft characterisation, shown through action, reaction and a lot of silence.",4
  I just loved this. The themes it explored regarding a young mans sexuality as well as growing up in a rough neighborhood were something that was hard to watch at times. Themes that have traditionally been far too unexplored in film.Excellent cinematography as well as performances.,4
"  I'm sure there are these types of stories out in the world, different parts of the world, even in our city. I'm so limited in my perspective when it comes to the world view & cinemas often help me to empathize & understanding of it. Though, I never been gone through what the main character went through and I can see his point of view of the reason why he made the choices of what he is & why. A great character study film, one in which not many people will understand or want to understand. I hope that if you get to see this film, watch & go through with open mine and heart.",4
"  ****'Moonlight' is beautiful, poignant, heart wrenching, and surprisingly thought-provoking. Many of us can relate to at least one aspect of Chiron's story, and I think that's what makes him such a captivating case study. As brilliant as the writing is, words mean nothing without good actors - and my oh my does this movie have some good performances. Everybody is absolutely perfect in their roles, and Writer/Director Barry Jenkins' fascinating direction makes the events taking place even more enthralling. The film may run a little too long, and ever so slightly drag in certain places, but these are mere nitpicks. This is a movie that must be seen.",4
"  This is a masterpiece. This is the definition of perfection.Moonlight was possibly the best movie I've ever seen.The plot was fantastic and beautifully written by Tarell Alvin McCraney, in each chapter he takes us on Chiron's though life journey. This masterpiece was marvelous from the beginning to the end.",5
  New story told. Cool more new stories,4
"  Before this film was made, the subject matter of toxic masculinity being socialized on young boys was only talked about in documentaries. When writer/Director Barry Jenkins broke this trend in 2016's best picture film there are many choices he could've made as a writer and director. By far the best decision was to keep the focus on this single universal theme and not to clutter it with others like race or socioeconomic status. Although race and poverty are there, he leaves them as expositonary background to our protagonist, not what drives the story. This helps magnify his focus on the heartache and social pressure our sexually confused protagonist feels from others. When Jenkins uses long shots and ""hero"" close-ups, combined with utter silence, no matter what the background of the audience member, male or female, black or white, you can't help but inject empathy into this character. This is the science of art and is executed to perfection.",5
"  Best movie I've seen all year (if not in several years). Truly, a must-see.",5
"  Very boring. Need subtitles to hear the small amount of speech there is. No laughter or smiles. Depreessing, without hope .",1
"  Went into this movie thinking I'd dislike it. Especially given the fact that it's a story about a poor, black, gay man, I was expecting to be slammed over the head with progressive lecturing. What an utter surprise, then, that Moonlight turned out to be a story that is, at its core, about the longing for intimacy and how that's uniquely manifested in this particular protagonist's life. It's also got strong acting and a killer visual style, to boot. What an absolute beauty of a film. Truly worthy of its Best Picture win.",5
  Breathtaking photography,4
"  Very strong, good movie.",4
"  Mahershala Ali indeed has a good performance in this, but the real stars in my mind are the different actors who play Chiron. They do an amazing job of portraying how he changes through his life, yet each version is recognizable as the same person.",5
  MOONLIGHT is a tragic redemption coming of age masterpiece. It is in my favourite movies of all time and while it is at times painful to watch it is one of the most superbly made movies of this generation. Full review is now up on Salty Popcorn.,5
  Breathtaking. One of the best movie's I've ever seen.,5
"  I thought I was going to adore this film as it seems every news paper seems to love it, it won the golden globe for best drama. But I just didn't. In theory moonlight should be great. It chronicles the three stages of life of a closeted Black man(boy) as he deals with his first encounter with love, constant bullying and a household with a mother who does more crack than Tyrone Biggum. That sounds like a great tale, but I just didn't care. It throws you into the film abruptly and I never felt the connection to the character that I would've wished for. My favorite character is the father figure that struggles with a relationship as the mothers plug and the kids mentor. He just kinda gets written off and I think he could've been a character that could've offered so much more. I loved the score, cinematography and acting and that's the main reason for the rating I've gave it. I don't want to sound like some privileged white person but look at la la land compared to moonlight on the surface. Moonlight: a story that involves an all black cast chronicles the struggle with being a closeted homosexual. La la land: a majority white cast about a white guy who saves jazz. I'm not saying that's why so many people like moonlight but I think a lot of people wanted a change from the regular vanilla films made in Hollywood. Moonlight is good, striving aesthetically but lacks a connection to the audience that would make it a world beater.",4
"  It's a slow burner, but worth it. The acting is excellent, the emotions raw and the music sublime. The school violence scenes were extremely gripping and moving.",4
"  It well deserved its award. The direction is amazing. Great cinematography, score, lighting, sound and camera work: a real piece of art!",5
"  Serious, depressing type drama about a boy's life in the hood of Miami. Acting is great as per usual among Oscar nominated movies, but of course it's still very slow paced and dull(again, as per usual with Oscar nominated movies). It features a lot of long awkward pauses with questions being unanswered. Can't say I really recommend this one, but I've seen worse.",2
  An absolute masterpiece,5
"  Terrible film, no story line and weird",0
"  Such a well done, moving, unpredictable, unformulaic film. Opens windows of enlightenment.",5
  November 27th - 28th 2017,5
  Probably the best film I've seen this year,5
"  Before you ramble on me hating on this movie. I didn't like this movie, the story was bland and that's it. Does not deserve the oscar.",2
  Not really sure what to write. I know that everyone was talking about this movie and how great it was but I think it was the subject matter that they enjoyed. I wasn't entertained. The ending was one of the most anticlimactic endings I've endure in awhile,1
  sloww... and overrated,2
"  I'm late to seeing this film, but I am so glad that I did. Of everything that I'll say about this film, I want to say that I appreciate this film for portraying very nuanced emotions and not creating a hyper-dramatic piece to shock audiences. When discussing something as sensitive as LGBTQ people of color, I believe it should be handled with care. In the end, Chiron feels like a real human being, not a cinematic one.All of the performances in this film were wonderful, so wonderful that I could not stop watching once I started.The music and cinematography were both completely on point as well. Once I finished watching, I felt like I had watched the birth, death, and rebirth of a soul. It was so true to someone's experience that I felt physically heavy throughout the film. I fully believe anyone seeking an authentic experience should watch this film.",5
  Waste of time. I don't understand the awards this movie received.,0
"  This is one hell of a great movie. I am sure most people have at least a idea of what the film is about. But anyway here is what I knew. Moonlight is a film about a man from the streets of Miami FL. The man is a gay nan and the story, his story in three parts of his life. When he was a boy, when he was a teen, and when he?s a grow man somewhere between the age of 20-30. That is all I knew and I don?t think gives away anything. The acting is just superb. Honestly I don?t see how this movie could be any better",5
  Brilliant acting and directing. A slow burn that's worth the wait.,4
"  Really enjoyed the movie , it had a deep underlying message, overall everyone needs love no matter skin, color nor gender .",5
  Super over hyped and absolutely 100% predictable. The amount of greased pockets at the Academy to award this trash as best picture could have fried a mountain of French Fries the size of Mount Everest.,1

"  I knew next to nothing about this movie, I knew it was about a young man coming into his own but I did not know any other details. This is such a beautiful, heartbreaking story that I did not expect. It left me bawling like a baby, great film, so much left unsaid and so much not explained but told so perfectly. Don't miss this one.",5
"  The beginning of a man's life. Not a criminal, not a politician: just a man. 10 minutes in, I felt no regrets. Half way through, I felt so satisfied with movies in a while.",4
"  Everything about this film is excellent. A special shoutout to Andre Holland, who did not get enough love come awards season.",5
"  Not what I was expecting, structurally the film is well made, with a tender, emotional side that only hit me right at the end.",4
"  The beauty of Moonlight comes from the cultivation of drama that rises above mere event tragedy. The film operates on an intensely personal level, developing visually rather than audibly, and provides a deeply satisfying conclusion. Though the subject is so deeply niche, Moonlight is a story of relationships, and one in particular that touches the viewers heart.",4
  Mahershala Ali needs all the attention. he is so good.,4
"  It's simply not right that I wanted more of this movie. The 1st and 2nd acts of this movie promise something that could be so profound, earth shattering and revolutionary. But it goes small in the 3rd act, becoming timid and ponderous. We see the destination of Chiron. But the movie shorthands the journey and romanticizes the ending. That said, I fucking loved it.",4
"  Moonlight is the story of young black child's struggle to find himself in a hard and unaccepting world. This film took me by surprise, it is a brilliantly subtle, realistic and heartfelt depiction of a young man's struggle with his own sexuality and how the world around him effects his identity. The script and the acting is so realistic that it often feels like you've stepped into someone's else's shoes and are watching a real life happening in front of your eyes rather than a film. The film is broken into 3 chapters, Little, Chiron and Black and the 3 actors who portray Chiron, Alex R. Hibbert, Ashton Sanders, Trevante Rhodes are all fantastic, portraying an inner struggle that's just bubbling underneath the surface. Naomie Harris is also excellent as Paula, Chiron's drug addicted mother, showing a great progression in her character as her addiction gets worse.. The film is also beautifully shot and paced with an excellent soundtrack that elevates the story and gives the whole film a quiet grace. Although the narrative itself isn't the most original, it is a beautiful film that tells it's story in very emotional and effective way.",4
  Crap! Absolute crap!,0
  You will watch it. You will love it. You will watch it again. Then you will listen to the soundtrack. You will find yourself not wanting to let it go. It's a unique experience.,5
"  IMHO, Moonlight is another 2016 movie which is overrated (besides Manchester by the Sea of course). Don't get me wrong, it is a good movie, but it wasn't that great. Maybe just maybe, because it is capturing the social issue of a true minority (black and gay), so it has everybody attentionAs for the performance, the one that shines in this movie IMHO is Thandie Newton alone. While for Mahershala Ali's won at the oscar? Well, it just a good performance in the right movie, not the one that will blown you away like Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight, Christopher Plummer in Beginners, or J.K. Simmons in Whiplash.Overall, it was a good movie about the journey of life (divided into 3 chapter : kid, teen, and adult). However I still enjoy Boyhood very much in the category of a movie about a kid growing up",4
  perfect scenes and very genuine interpretation of a life experience that I may never understand. Beautiful,4
"  A joy for the eyes, a subtle and enchanting cinematic spectacle that speaks somehow the truth for so many people out there who face the worst face of life everyday. It is a moving and neatly executed romance, a fantastic breath of fresh air and simultaneously a predictable one. But it is indeed a worthy oscar winner and for sure the best movie of 2016.",4
"  5/5. An excellent film that has fantastic acting all around, an investing story, and some of the most tense scenes I have ever seen on film.",5
"  ""Moonlight' was easily one of the slowest most un thought provoking Films of the year. But in saying this ""Moonlight"" did have some nice character moments, especially in the first half. The Plot to ""Moonlight"" is A timeless story of human self-discovery and connection, Moonlight chronicles the life of a young black man from childhood to adulthood as he struggles to find his place in the world while growing up in a rough neighbourhood of Miami. The Direction by ""Barry Jenkins"" I found to be very choppy at times by having no idea what he wanted to do with what he had. I could tell by watching the film (especially in the second half) that he didn't know how to show these characters as being likeable, had no idea how to skip time periods and didn't know what to put in the final cut of the film and what not to put in. Which brings me onto the editing. The editing in this film I found super hard to keep up with and is one of the main reasons there where so many plot holes. The Acting in this I found to be really good, one of the only great things about this film in my opinion. The main standouts for me where ""Mahershala Ali"" and ""Janelle Monáe"". Even though these two actors had minimal time on screen they made the most of their screen time and where super believable. The Characters in this film where all over the place. The main protagonist being Alex who you see grow on screen. This character I found to be very annoying at times and then slightly likeable at other times. The character that I thought was the most believable and likable was Teresa, this is mainly caused by ""Janelle Monáe"" doing a great job in her role but the screenplay also helped as well. Speaking of the screenplay, I found it to be atrociously written at many points. With some major plot holes and not knowing what happened to many characters one main example being Juan. The Score composed by ""Nicholas Britell"" was exceptionally composed and worked perfectly with the film. One of the biggest issues I had with ""Moonlight"" was the pacing. The pacing had huge issues with it being way too slow in the second half. I'm majorly surprised I made it through the whole film. The first half of the film had an okay, it was still slow at times but it was watchable. But once it got into the third act, the film just put on its brakes and went to a full on halt. Although one scene I did like from the film was when the main protagonist Alex was with a supporting character Juan at a beach and Juan was teaching Alex to swim. I found that scene to have a big impact on the character and moved the story along well. Overall I found ""Moonlight"" to have some good character moments, excellent acting from two supporting roles ""Mahershala Ali"" and ""Janelle Monáe"", and an excellent score that went perfectly with the film. Although it did have major issues with the pacing in the second half, chopping directing, a few annoying characters, a screenplay that was horribly written and horrific editing. I give 2016's ""Moonlight"" a 3.5/10.",1
  This is one of those movies that will make you think for months after watching it. Proves that a solid story doesn't need a huge budget. It needs heart.,5
  Not sure what all the hype was about. Predictable and slow. Poor acting,2
"  To be young, black, poor, and gay is a serious predicament in the USA. Barry Jenkins' film shows, in three acts with three actors, one man's development, growing from a bullied young boy to an awkward uncertain youth, to a strong and silent man. His crack-addicted mother (Naomie Harris) casts a huge shadow over everything, adding more difficulties, although for the context (Liberty City, Miami), this may reflect some sad sort of normal. Even his caring and altruistic self-appointed mentor (played charismatically by Mahershala Ali) is also a drug-dealer. So, although alienation is the order of the day, real human intervention has lasting effects; sensitive and caring moments, sensitively portrayed, help Little/Chiron/Black to navigate the troubled world, perhaps like beacons of light in the darkness. The film itself looks beautiful (with black skin looking blue in the moonlight, a poetic phrase that is the source of the title) and there are numerous arthouse moves that reveal the film's goals to be more aesthetic than your typical narrative feature. Yes, there are autobiographical notes here for Jenkins (extending also from Tarell Alvin McCraney's play) but this is not your usual Oscar-winning biopic - it is something deeper, more personal, touching and affecting, human and heartbreaking.",4
  I have seen this movie and I find nothing appreciative. It's just another boring movie. Can someone tell me what's so oh-ha about it!,1
  This movie is so fucking horrible! So boring! No emotion! No fun! No meaning! 1/10,0
"  A brilliantly realized character study of a young man whose existence is questioned and his sexuality repressed by the environment he comes from. Kevin is a boy who grows up to a crack addicted mother (Naomie Harris) and spends much of his childhood with her drug dealer (Mahershala Ali) and his motherly girlfriend (Janelle Monae). Fast forward to his teenage years and we see a very candid kiss between Kevin and his friend Chiron. The third, and final chapter, shows Kevin in his troubled adulthood searching for answers about what the true meaning of love is. It's quiet and powerful and so well acted that it flows indelibly. Truly stirring performances by an unknown ensemble that shows a reflection of how our society views masculinity and femininity in current culture.",5
"  Moonlight doesn't miss a beat. Amazing direction, characters, arcs, style, realism, and everything else a movie can possibly offer. It's a perfect film.",5
"  This was very a very new experience for me in terms of movies and topics. I wasn't expecting what happened, to happen in the movie. Great movie though.",4
  How this movie almost lost Best Picture to La La Land is beyond me.,4
  Great movie about growing up black and gay in a low income neighboorhood. less sad than i expected but very compelling.,4
"  So much hype. Sure those lives are too rarely seen in cinema, but widely seen on the streets, and that's enough.",1
"  Considering this movie takes place over the span of like, twenty years, you'd think that at least one or two things would happen in it.",1
"  I finally got around to watching this. A slow, beautiful, subtle and understated coming of age film. Certainly deserved the Oscar win. Superb performances and excellent camera work.",5
"  Moonlight is a tender exploration of sexuality and self-acceptance. A parable of life in underprivileged ghettos of society, told with the upmost delicacy and respect. Whilst Moonlight focuses on the American working class black community, it's moral theme of cyclical self-depreciation and desperation could be retold in any home devoid of love or community lacking hope. Given the subject matter Moonlight could have been an arduously grim experience. However Jenkins crafts Moonlight masterfully, punctuating the bleak storyline with sumptuous cinematography and a juxtaposing classical score. Told through three snapshots of Chiron's coming of age, a uniformly superb cast keep us engaged. Part of the viewers frustration at Chiron is that he misses the glimmers of hope - such as the tender hearted acceptance of Juan and Teresa - and concludes with a touching optimism that his future may lead him down a more satisfying path. Whilst it's far from the stereotypical Oscar winner chock full of barn-storming dramatics and elongated ""nomination bait"" speeches, Moonlight's subtlety sticks with you. A brave tale told in a bold and unique manner.",5
  Boring. Felt like a great 30 minute documentary that was dragged out to 2 hours.,2
  A Hollywood favorite for all the suspected reasons.Skip it Middle America,0
"  It succeeds by being pretty much unique in its cool portrayal of a topic rarely treated this way, it has many tender moments of varying degrees, and is all beautifully filmed. However, it offers no glimmer of real hope or optimism, and utterly fails to address the betrayal so brutally thrown in front of us - as though making a hard life look good is enough. Almost every scene, on its own, is excellent, but the story they tell together is stereotyped and very problematic. And there's some very over done shaky-cam close-up footage.",4
  fucken sweet ass movie,4
"  12/8/17 How did this win the best picture? It didn't even have a storyline. This kid is born in thr hood to a drug addicted mother, gets brought up by a drug baron, and as a side note is gay. Not good",1
"  Either I haven't seen anything like it, or this piece its truly one of a kind. Amazing colors and acting. Solid way to tell a story. A few of the shots do feel a little bit staged but are executed in a beautiful way that you might not care. If you don't like analyzing anything just skip this movie.",5
"  Moonlight is a movie directed by Barry Jenkins, and is about a person named Chiron who struggles to realize who he really is, told within 3 chapters of his life starting with him as a young kid, then, to him being a teenager, and then, with him being an adult. I have got to say that this movie was brilliant! Every single part in this film is just perfect! The acting, the writing, the cinematography (which by the way is OUTSTANDING in the film), and the directing by Barry Jenkins is one of a kind. The cast in this film was BEYOND brilliant! The score to this film is riveting! I cannot wait to see what Director Berry Jenkins will make next! Afterwards, Moonlight is a masterpiece by Barry Jenkins, and is a great movie with extremely powerful performances.",5
  In my opinion this move is so slow and boring. Very overrated. Naomi performance is still great. I can't understand why this film won the Oscar instead of La La Land.,2
"  A movie that panders to the mainstream audience by dealing with the predictable issues of sexuality, poverty, and race. Nothing in this film is remotely revolutionary in any sense of the word. Instead of weaving a subtle, yet genius story-line with several great opportunities for stunning plot-twists, the movie tells a generic story about a homosexual African American man that feels tailored to this generation of viewers.",2
"  Worthy drama but due to the pacing and ambiguous script didn't merit the time invested. I was amazed by the critical reaction and can only assume this was down to the subject matter, which in itself seems a bit patronizing. Acting was earnest but overall a real disappointment due to the silly hype.",2
"  this was really emotional and sometimes hard to watch, but it's so beautiful in such an original way. There's so much to learn just by watching this. the performances were great. the more I think about it, the more I think this is a film I'll remember for a long time.",5
"  Worried about more ""Black' lash, Hollywood gave this an award. It doesn't matter no one saw it anyway.",0
"  What an overrated garbage film. I'm not racist. I can respect a good film. Dope was an academy award winning film next to this ""heart wrenching epic""... HAH. I almost fell asleep twice and I was on an airplane with nowhere else to go and nothing else to do and it still couldn't keep my attention. I'm pretty well read, but this was not worthy of an academy nod let alone best film!!!! Now, I will suggest that the build up and high expectation of watching this after winning best film could have influenced my opinion but it was pretty awful. Best of luck watching.",1
"  The movie was slow and boring. To think this could have won best pic of the year is utterly amazing! It is different, I'll give it that, but one of the worst movies I've ever seen.",0
"  Not the best picture about the topic, but a really good one.",4
"  A compassionate rumination on race, sexuality and identity, speaking for voices rarely heard in cinema.",5
"  Really just the best movie ever. I cried through the entire thing. The way the camera treated the black male body, the careful and profoundly non-manipulative way the story wove around the mother, the tender love between the men. Absolutely perfect.",5
"  Horrible , I don't get all the hype! La la land should've got the award!",1
"  If there is any feeling that director-screenwriter Barry Jenkins captures masterfully -- I'm speaking mostly from an outsider perspective -- it's the feeling of your whole life moving far too quickly to recall anything other than the few moments when it all seemed to slow down. For better or worse. The characters under scrutiny are also a welcome change to the near-homogeneity of most contemporary films, not just with respect to white upper-middle class but also the tough/macho-by-social-law culture of black below-poverty-line class. Moonlight certainly has its important place in today's time. We'll see where Hollywood goes (or Barry Jenkins, for that matter), in ten years' time. As for the story itself, well, it's another coming-of-age, finding-yourself tale. The simple change in who is of focus makes this an especially durable piece of storytelling, not to mention remarkable pacing and structure. ""Little"" / Chiron / ""Black"" (the same person played by three different actors, all of whom deserve praise for their breakthrough performances) is soft at the core, and as he ages, we see how his environment forces him to build a cold, rough exterior when all he wants is to feel soft again with someone he loves. I would argue that Moonlight is undeniably beautiful, but then again, see the ~18% gap between critical favourability and audience favourability? The 18% will explain to you how the fact that Chiron is ""too much of everything"": black, poor, homosexual. And in come the accusations that Jenkins is trying too hard. To which I say, fuck you.",5
"  This movie is clearly the lowest budget of all the Best Picture nominees, and has the least narrative structure as well. Not that that's a bad thing, it's just different. Rather than tell a defined story, the film is broken up into three segments, each one a snapshot of different points of a single character's life. The first two are fantastic, the third... well, not so much. That third act was SOOO SLOOOOW, it detracted from my overall enjoyment of the film. The movie still packs a solid emotional punch, thanks to the first two acts. This is an important movie, if nothing other than the fact that I think this is the only movie I have ever seen where the main character is a black gay guy. Even so, the themes are universal that anyone can relate to. This is a poignant film with a lot to say, even though it doesn't come right out and tell you. You feel it rather than hear it.",4
"  I thought this movie was incredibly boring. It was difficult to get through entirely without turning the movie off. The underlying plot was very realistic and touching, but the movie itself was, in my opinion very boring. Then again good movies are few and far between these days.",2
"  Real raw emotion, well shot. Powerful through ugly and beautiful moments of one man's story.",4
  A hauntingly beautiful movie... though not sure if it was Best Picture worthy.,4
"  Moonlight tells the story of a young, gay man as he goes through life. The first act depicts his childhood, the second are his teenage years and the third is him as a grown man in present day. It is a brutally honest depiction of the LGBT struggle, especially for a young black man growing up in a largely conservative community effected by drugs and poverty. The subject matter is heavy, but it opens up a conservation that we NEED to have. Despite these very sad themes, there is a great deal of heart to Moonlight. It's hard to describe without spoilers but trust me it is there. Lastly I also want to point out that for those of you who are familiar with the work of Kendrick Lamar (specifically To Pimp a Butterfly) you'll notice artistic inspirations that Kendrick and Moonlight share. The first song heard in Moonlight is ""Every Nigga is a Star"" by Boris Gardiner, one of the main characters is listening to the song on his radio in the opening scene. In the first song of TPAB, ""Wesley's Theory"" the same piece is sampled at the very beginning of the song, its the first sound you hear when you listen to the album. There are other small details that both works share. Needless to say great minds think alike. The original soundtrack for Moonlight is especially powerful. Normally I'm not a fan of classical soundtracks in films (it's a little overdone) but Moonlight's classical OST is so uniquely well done that I would be idiotic not to make an exception. Cinematography is stylized and strong. Iconic scenes, beautiful colors and lighting make for sophisticated and detailed cinematography that is not only aesthetically pleasing but also highly symbolic. Truly a legendary film",5
"  Slow-moving, boring and pointless. Just because a movie aspires to show lives too rarely seen in cinema does not mean it succeeds. Also, the acting is terrible.",0
  Not worth all the fuss. Gets quite boring near the end.,2
"  Great storytelling, execution but I'm not sure it deserves the Oscar",4
"  Moonlight is a film that is a piece of cinematic masterclass. The perromences of Mahershala Ali and Ashton Sanders set the movie from the get go to be a gripping, enticing and real portrayal of life as a young African american finding his way through childhood and adulthood in a ghetto. The character construction of Kevin and Juan are pivotal to the films success as these set the beginning and end to what would be Barry Jenkins idea of the Circle of Life in America right now. Kevin we see grow up and struggle to find his identity due conflicting issues with his mother, himself, and society. This plays a key role in the plot depth and this is the backbone of the film, this alone certifies it as a respectable film. However, the open endness of Moonlight and social commentary it attaches itself too is what makes the film stand out. With the transformation of Kevin ending with him finally accepting who hes is, the audience leaves the theater with a sense of happiness yet overwhelming heartbreak as the Kevin has subsequently become a product of his environment forming into a eerily similar character to Juan. The films little dialogue and excellent cinematography, the audience is left alone with themselves often, which i believe was an asset to the films message. The film is multi layered with a breadth of masterclass performances, even from Barry Jenkins.",4
  Beautiful cinematography and touching story.,5
"  Moonlight is a beautiful drama film which shows the outstanding capabilities of black people in the film industry while also shining a positive light on the otherwise controversial LGBTQI+ community. This film won the Academy Award for Best Picture and it totally deserves it! This type of film is rarely seen in cinema which is a shame but it was refreshing to watch after all these films coming out which are just cliché. Moonlight, go watch it if you haven't already.",4
"  It was a good movie. It had unnecessary, slow paced scenes but other than that the story was good. There are three Acts/Phases for the protagonist. You witness the highlight of Chiron's life from when he's a kid, a teenager, and then adulthood. What I'm baffled as to why this movie passed up as the best motion picture when there were scenes that had nothing to do about Chiron's life or anything that would pertain the story itself. While the cinematography, the acting, and of course the development of the story according to Chiron, it was all done so well. Especially portraying the bullying and with one's personal struggle throughout life. While the interpretation is well made, Chrion's interactions with other characters were quite limited. It would have been nice if there were more scenes between them and Chiron, so they're more portrayed than they already are. Don't get me wrong, this movie really is well done and so if anyone's curious to pick this up then go for it. It really is the best motion picture drama of 2016.",4

  A movie that represents problems with people and there life dealing with these problems. The story is compelling and makes the audience fight for the main characters. Relatable moments in our own lives is what drives the eagerness from the audience. Sexuality and differences are a huge deal and the way Barry Jenkins wrote it in regards to a young kid struggling all the way up to adult hood is breathtaking as this movie is very realistic.,5

"  (Best Picture Winner at 2016 Oscars)After the Oscar flub, I was kinda chapped that this film actually beat La La Land, my favorite film of 2016 at Best Picture. After that messup, I chose to check this film out to see what the Critics were getting at with it's phenomenal reviews. Those reviews including Chris Stuckmann's (My Favorite Movie Reviewer) A+ Review. I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. It was a kind of film that I haven't seen before, a film looking at a man's life through three stages; Child, Teen, and Adult while he struggles with the truth that he has bisexual feelings for his best friend. This film was beautiful Writing wise and Cinematography wise. This film had an excellent script accompanied by beautiful unique shots. Props to writer/director Barry Jenkins for making a visual masterpiece. The acting was excellent also. Mahershala Ali deserved that Best Supporting Actor Award, He was amazing in this film. The three guys playing Chiron did excellent portraying a guy trying to figure out where his life is going and his feelings for other characters. Ashton Sanders in my opinion was the best portrayal as the Teenage Chiron in high school figuring out himself. Naomie Harris did well as an addict mom who figures out in the end that she was a bad parent and that she actually loved her son. Janelle Monáe also did excellent as the mother figure that Chiron always wanted. The score was an excellent fit for the film. The tracks fit the scenes so perfectly. Overall, I'm not chapped that this film beat out La La Land for Best Picture because this film is a very excellent runnerup against La La Land. It was an excellent film visually and story telling wise. An Excellent Watch! Would have definitely been in my top 10 of 2016 if I had seen it before the year ended.Rating: 9.5/10",4

"  Finally got to see ""Moonlight"" on Blu ray, because we don't get a lot of Indy films in my little town. I heard a lot of Buzz about this movie and saw that it won a lot of awards, so naturally I was really wanting to see this one in the worst kind of way. I must say, it is beautifully shot, and artfully directed. The cast was great. All of the performance were tremendous. The standout for me, by far, was Naomie Harris as the mother of Chiron. I did feel the emotions that the characters were feeling and Mr. Jenkins does a great job keeping you invested in the film. With all that now being said, this movie is way overhyped. Yes the movie is acted and directed well but the actual story did not do a lot for me. Also there were aspects of the film that seemed out of place and definitely this is not a film for everyone. If you love it that is great and I understand but I do not see best picture o0f the year here.",4
  Great performance by Naomie Harris,0
"  There is a sparcity of words and action that I find unbearable...I couldn't make it through the whole thing. Also I just didn't see the gayness about him that everyone in the film seemed to see and ridiculed him for especially when he was very little. His mom said he walked in a certain way, I just didn't see that. As a result all the movie did is frustrate me.",2
"  At Its Core, An Insubordinate Drama Where Transcends Racial Hate & HomophobiaApparently, American film colossus learned from the popular debacles of the past, now it starts a thorough inquiry in order to unveil stories implicating everything and everyone. Just a year ago, totalitarian society was embedded in the protests, led by movie personalities of color, for the small amount of participation of any-non-English-speaking actor or filmmaker in different annual film festivals, emphasizing the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Months later, either objectively or subjectively, the more than 1,000 Academy members have nominated a heterogeneous movie range, in which ethnicity is preeminent, striving for the most significant awards of the evening: ""Best Motion Picture"" and ""Best Director"" (""Moonlight"" or ""Fences""). One of the most eloquent contenders is Barry Jenkins' neo-creation, if we interpret it in a superficial way, illustrates three formative periods in correlative gradation of a gay black male, however, scrutinizing it from the inside out, we notice a limpid treatment about a little-known environment by huge studios, one where poverty, loneliness, orphanhood, violence, drug abuse, and intolerance ravage to any boy residing by such degrading places. Not necessarily you must be African-American or gay to converge your own existential opinions with Chiron's, this is because it's defined as a universal tale both in effect and purpose; an important epic supported by the reality, using to aesthetic and melodic lyricism to remind the spectator a truism that is being ignored to collective will, something doesn't require a harmless seasoned to cover its importance, rough beauty and ordinary human need within a quasi-two-hour motion picture.It begins with a circular tracking shot to place the audience into the perverse place where the main character will have to grow up, an atmosphere which breaths dioxide formed by the miasma of bullets, prostitution, vices, scams, sex, narcotics and death. The films encompassing African-American marginalized populations tends to implement certain hallmarks produced by social disruption, which is caused by deficiencies (social exclusion, police brutality or educational neglect) leading an unsuspected doctrinal starting point. Jenkins, who's devoted to these ""stereotypes"" of films about black race, delineates naturally a Miami punished by the sun, space where Chiron's hilarities, notions, dreams, disappointments, learnings, decisions, and fluids that go from scarlet blood or saline sobs to the experimental sperm were fixed to torrid precarious ground of American ghettos, experiences richly raised through three temporary gradations (childhood, youth and adulthood) marked by three irrefutable denotations of the character in question (Little, Chiron, and Black).""You can be gay, but you don't have to let nobody call you a faggot""Narratively, it can be compared with dense, epic and fatiguing Richard Linklater's ""Boyhood"", ""Moonlight"" employs narrative in sections as standalone episodes comprising altogether an intense realism, an initiative bracing the trip and psychic and emotional spurs of the characters. The whole product is much more than the sum of its parts. It expels conviction, transformation and freedom of all kinds; It's something that concerns you and gets under your skin beyond the closing credits. Fractional exposition allows more intimate contact with what happens to Little, young or mature man; each chapter works as an independent installment, splendidly played by an ardent diverse cast, photography as real as visceral, a soundtrack combines emotional position of a given moment and a series of components employs simplicity and truthfulness as info carrier. It entails entirely the kind of film which is imperative for us more than ever, one that talks about what can happen a common human being and grows apart itself from the oneiric. It's patent the limited trust around nobility of our existence to conceive art, we make other worlds rather than appealing infinity of opportunities are around us. The visuals are marvelous, repel the tendency of those recurring feature films using desaturation and dreadmist to portray real-life occurrences. Here, fluorescent bright colors come together dark contrast in order to animate and give a distinct personality to each planned segment, mise-en-scène intensifies its fantastic beauty with precise camera movements at the hands of skilled James Laxton. Music, light and camera aesthetically shape the movie, equipping with sensitivity and depth Chiron's life, while simultaneously, it reduces the inherent hostility of the American atmosphere. Visual and writing screenplay combined with tremendous credibility, while John (one of the most humane performances of a drug dealer in the cinema history by California native Mahershala Ali) recites to Chiron the origin of his nickname (Blue), the story applies optionally sparkling moonlight involvement in the last scene, in which he invites us to do the same he did, to try to define us, not to fear, to be who want to be, to develop a global principle entrusted to humanity; living in freedom.Barry Jenkins' ""Moonlight"" officially starts the participation of two of the social groups more unjustly repudiated by contemporary society: black race and homosexuals. Each person can draw deductions, opinions and criticisms, but the truth is that what these men and women-dedicated to cause a change-have made is a fearless and decisive social and filmic feat, which's realized by universal subjects such as youth, rashness, self-improvement, love, masculinity, and life. ""Moonlight"" is a grade-A drama, literally powerful, visually linked to the truth; its power doesn't come from complex intelligible narrative tricks, the charm lies in connection with the characters and the unintentional identification with coexistence human nature: acceptance (tolerance).",4
  Amazing picture. I never knew I wanted it but here it is. Just go watch it.,5

"  Coming into this film I didn't know too much about it. I knew that it is a film set in different stages in a man's life, and he's trying to find himself. It seemed interesting, but once I saw the praise it was getting I had to look into it. Although I thought the whole Best Picture fiasco was horrible for the awards show, I am tremendously happy that Moonlight ended up winning Best Picture. The reason why is because it is an absolutely beautiful film. The acting is phenomenal, and I really believe that Viola should've been in the Best Actress in a Leading Role category, with Naomie Harris then winning Supporting Actress, but I digress. The cinematography and direction is stunning throughout, and the narrative as a whole is beautiful to follow. All three actors that played Chiron were tremendous, and I'm glad Mahershala Ali won an Oscar for his role. This is both an important film and a truly emotional film. This is my favorite film of 2016, and it is definitely one of my favorite films of all-time.",5

"  Lejos de la artificiosidad y el academicismo de obras como ""La Chica Danesa"" o ""The Imitation Game"", así como del cansino drama social de nulo interés artístico, ""Moonlight"" supone un auténtico acercamiento a la figura de su protagonista, al que retrata con una sensibilidad que pocas veces tenemos ocasión de ver en este tipo de cine oscarizable. Si nos ponemos a analizar superficialmente, ""Moonlight"" no deja de ser una película sobre una persona que, tras muchos palos y esfuerzo, logra aceptarse a sí misma. Lo que la convierte en una obra muy notable es precisamente que no se queda ahí, sino que realiza una verdadera radiografía social, tratando situaciones como el acoso escolar, la pobreza, la drogadicción y, sobre todo, la homosexualidad, sin que podamos percibir (y esto es de agradecer) el mínimo atisbo de fetichización, tocando el tema con gran naturalidad, dentro de la anomalía que supone la homosexualidad en el entorno del protagonista.Una de las principales críticas que he leído sobre la película es que cae demasiado en los tópicos. Sí, se vale de algunos tópicos para hacer avanzar la trama, pero por otra parte es lógico, puesto que aunque nos empeñemos en lo contrario, los clichés en el cine existen porque, de alguna forma u otra, se aproximan a la realidad. ""Moonlight"" no es una excepción, y la verdad es que funcionan. La película en ningún momento se siente disparatada o impensable, sino que es absolutamente factible y, de hecho, bastante probable, que la historia que cuenta sea muy similar a la de muchas personas. A mí personalmente no me importa lo más mínimo el uso moderado de clichés, pues la película está tan bien narrada y me resulta tan sincera y honesta en lo que quiere transmitir que conecto con ella en todo momento. Me parece además un gran acierto el haber estructurado la película en tres grandes partes completamente diferenciadas (lo cual no deja de ser un introducción-nudo-desenlace de manual), pues esto permite un uso mucho más libre de las elipsis, en mi opinión sabiamente utilizadas, obteniendo como resultado una más que correcta narración... aunque, eso sí, con sus pequeños altibajos, especialmente en el tercer y último tercio.Cabe destacar también una estupenda fotografía, que da lugar a escenas de gran fuerza e impacto visual, incluyendo algunas verdaderamente poéticas.Poco más que decir, para mí una de las mejores películas de 2016. Habrá que seguir de cerca al tal Jenkins...",4
  It's Miami By the Sea. So I'm giving it the same rating.,2
"  It is not surprising how the critical notes and the normal users are different moonllight is a film difficult to understand often with a heavy tone even for a drama in this type, and it is very gratifying to see the evolution of chiron during the 3 acts Of the film all three actors that interprets it are many good, carry with themselves the weight and the motivations of the character but they are never equal that leaves the special film since the acting until the boy that stars in the first part of the film is phenomenal, The performances in general are perfect the soundtrack composed by classical music is phenomenal and the evolution of the plot is very good, the film shows what it is like to be a man in black society prejudice, homosexuality, and how two people can follow similar paths but a lot Different at the same time, a great deserving of the Oscar who won, note 100",5
  Unlike anything you've seen before but better.,5
  Nope. Just depressing...,1
  Good character development. Non-story.,4
"  This one was better than La La Land, in my opinion, so I'm glad it won. The acting was terrific by all performers. The story was touching and believable. I cared about the main characters, despite criminality, and wanted happiness for them--proof of good story telling. If it were all about the negatives, it would be hard to get through. It's about human spirit, forgiveness, tenderness in a backdrop of despair and hardship. The feel of it is similar to Manchester by the Sea, another very good movie that hits notes of deep emotions, only a different race and place.",0
  I really wanted to like this... but I couldn't get past the pacing. I do appreciate the premise and the intersection. I'm just disappointed in the boredom I experienced during the entire film.,0
  although the story kept me watching each chapter wondering what's next......the movie just ended wirth me going THAT'S IT!?!?!?!? i guess i was looking to see if the bullies got revenge or how they turned out. and i guess i was looking for him to try a woman but that didn't happenSo most definitely unpredictable just like i like my movies it just wasn't my type of movie.i need more actiondefinitely wouldn't have gotten my vote for the academy awards,4
  Very well put together story of a black man growing up gay in Miami. Great acting pulling you into the drama of the interactions he had with peers and the help he received from a couple who became surrogate parents.,4
"  Dealt with very real, very relevant challenges in the hood. The suffering is real. Eyeballs sweating at the end.",5
  Terrific movie! Moonlight lives up to all the hype.,5
"  The first half of the movie is very good, then the final act is just an underwhelming conversation that leads to a poor attempt at a non ending.",2
  A bit joyless in a Brokeback Mountain kind of way. But I guess that's the whole point.,4
  This movie looks like it cost 10x more than it did. The performances and craft are pretty revelatory. Biggest surprise: a spot-on classical soundtrack.,4
  Intense. And wonderfully acted and directed,4
"  I'm not sure if I saw the best picture of the year. While it was a good character driven story about a black, soft spoken, homosexual from a tough uprising, I prefer some of the other nominated pictures. Slow pacing",4
"  glowing, raw and beautiful",5
  Absolute Garbage. Saw 10 people leave the cinema during the beach scene. LMAO,0
"  Barry Jenkins finds a masterpiece in Moonlight, a drama with fulfilled potential of great proportions. It's well acted, emotionally gut-wrenching and it provides an insightful look at lives that the film industry doesn't focus on too often.",5
"  Even though this movie didn't really have a plot, it just was, it was an interesting look at something many people may have never thought about.",4
"  A strong, coming-of-age narrative, bringing to the forefront the undiscussed subject of a gay black boy's sexuality.",4
  I don't knew where the best part of this film who make 80% people like this.,2
  Rare slice of life film,4
  Unconventional love story with a lot of biographical background. It is a bit episodic but the power of its ending is not diminished.,4
  Amazing acting with a depth that pulls you in.,5
  Holy sh1t! Can't remember feeling this raw watching a movie in the last decade. Very difficult and emotionally tangling story with very little satisfaction of any kind throughout the film. It keeps on giving. It's a pretty horrendous experience and life of a young adult told in 3 stages of his life. Ultimately It is not meant to prove anything.,4
"  So touched, impressed. Making people think more after when the boy bathed under the moonlight.",4
"  Here's the rub- Moonlight is beautifully filmed, acted, directed and the narrative split into three acts is both seemless and elegant. I also liked Naomie Harris (in a largely over-looked performance) as the negligent crack- addict mum. The only thing that fell a bit short was Chyrone's teenage homosexual tryst with a school friend. I didn't feel that this brief encounter of lust would have captivated him on a romantic level (especially after the same 'friend' pummels him in the school yard to impress his peers). Is Chyrone suffering from Stockholm Syndrome? Is this the only man he's romantically attracted to? Someone who shares a joint and jerks him off, then repeatedly gay bashes him? Oh well, each to his own. Good film anyway",4
"  I see why the academy chose this film as the best picture. At the same time, it feels the same as I have seen before in a coming of age film even with the main character being gay.",2
"  Good direction of the characters and history, as well as giving them depth.However, I do not see the masterpiece of which it is spoken.",4
"  ""Moonlight"" is a beautifully filmed drama with powerful acting performances and deep direction that manages to capture genuine emotion and convey complex themes by showcasing a story of African-American lives that are usually not shown in cinemas.",5
"  It's depressing from the start to the finish, and I just don't see any significantly important point to the movie. Had to also read the plot of the movie to know exactly what is going on.",0
  This is what happens when someone pushes too hard the barriers of the politically correct.,1
  Better than all the nominees I've seen so far except Manchester by the Sea and Hell or High Water,4
  The story was enjoyable if you like the arty slow moving type of movie. I would not define as remarkable. What is quite sad is that he lives to see his mum go through the drug addiction and then chooses that parth of drug selling for himself. So he is a quiet intraverted character with no spine really.,0
  This is a must watch I keep believe how amazing this movie is. Every scene stuck out to me everything felt so real. The main character I felt so attached so fast this is an amazing movie story that everyone should give a chance.,5
"  It's strangely crafted with similar drama as one would find in a college feminist's story about the struggle of being a woman. That's not to dismiss that there is a real struggle that comes with being a woman, and likewise with being Black and gay, but the problem is that it relies too heavily on the sympathy of the audience to create their own engagement with the film solely on the fact that the main character has such struggles. A film can't simply have that most bare skeleton of a plot and be good. There has to be good characters, good acting, and nuance, and with all that together creates the engagement/intrigue. Sadly this film has none of that and opts to stay relatively flat and empty throughout, minus the bare minimum conflict that there actually was (which the film chooses not to follow even though it was the most interesting part). All in all, pretty dull.",2
"  I thought the story line was weak, and the dramatic change the main character goes through from Act 2 to 3 verges on the absurd and unbelievable. Mahershala Ali was crazy good and its message rang through sound and clear, but the movie overall was a let down (especially after seeing Moonlight embarrass all of La La Land because of the Best Picture fiasco).",2
"  Moonlight is artistic and achingly human; full of great performances, great direction and a thematic aesthetic. I love this movie and I would highly recommend it!",5
  I think this is one of the worst movies ever,0
"  Storyline is well developed and keeps the audience's interest. Felt that there should have been more to the movie but the message in the film is vivid. Would definitely recommend but perhaps not for a second time around. Overall, great acting, great storyline, and great vibe.",4
  Keeps you interested the whole way through. It's easy to get invested in,4
"  Ponderous story about growing up black, ridden with clichés like drug dealers, crack whores and prison. The only wrinkle is the kid is gay, and that mostly seems to serve for a lot of heavy, meaning-laden looks. Bleh.",2
"  This year's Best Picture at the Oscars. Based on the memories growing up in Miami's Liberty City, Barry Jenkins and Tarell Alvin McCraney tell a stunningly soulful and heartachingly intimate coming-of-age narrative about an African-American young man's gruelling throes to keep up with the expectations of black masculinity and to stay true to his identity.",4
  This was so goddamn beautiful. Not just visually but also performance and story wise as well. This is definitely not your average african american gangster film.,5
"  ""Amazingly well-acted and well-photographed, ""Moonlight"" shines as one of the best movies of 2016. It never strikes a wrong note.""Movie Review: MoonlightDate Viewed: January 24 2017Directed By Barry JenkinsScreenplay By Barry Jenkins, Story By Tarell Alvin McCraney, Based on the play ""In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue"" by Tarell Alvin McCraneyStarring: Trevante Rhodes, Ashton Sanders, Alex Hibbert, Jharrel Jerome, Andre Holland, Jaden Piner, Patrick Decile, Mahershala Ali, Naomie Harris and Janelle Monae.This beautiful and essential movie feels like the work of a great poet. ""Moonlight"" is a breathlessly stunning achievement from director Barry Jenkins and it also feels socially relevant due to dark times in America right now. ""Moonlight"" centers around a shy and quietly withdrawn child named Chiron whose story is told in three compelling chapters, i. Little (Childhood), ii. Chiron (Teenhood) and iii. Black (Adulthood).Amazingly well-acted and well-photographed by cinematographer James Laxton, ""Moonlight"" shines as one of the best movies of 2016. It never strikes a wrong note. In the first episode ""Little"", Chiron (Alex Hibbert) is a shy and quietly withdrawn child who gets picked on by a group of bullies and he runs and hides in an empty house. Chiron is later found by a crack dealer named Juan (Mahershala Ali) who takes him into his home where he scores an unlikely friendship with him. Chiron starts to open up and reveals that he has no father to raise him and he lives with her abusive and crack addict mother, Paula (Naomie Harris).Chiron turns to Juan and his live-in girlfriend, Teresa (Janelle Monae) more as his father/and mother figures and he spends more time with him and he also finds a friend named Kevin (Jaden Piner) who he grows more attached to. In the second chapter ""Chiron"", we see a teenaged Chiron (Ashton Sanders) who continues to be a close friend of Kevin (Jharrel Jerome) but he gets severely bullied daily by his fellow peer and student, Terrel (Patrick Decile). Even though Juan is now deceased, it doesn't stop Chiron from continuing to visit Teresa and he still often spends nights at her house because her mother is still a crack-addicted mess.Continuing to be the target of Terrel's relentless bullying, a social worker pressures Chiron to either suspend them or pressing any charges but he doesn't believe any of that is going to stop the bullying so he takes matters into his own hands by smashing a chair into Terrel's back which gets him arrested. Chiron's relationship with Kevin also turns estranged because he and Terrel partook in beating him up in the school yard.In the third chapter ""Black"", Chiron (Trevante Rhodes) is now a hardened adult and drug dealer who lives outside Atlanta and he now goes by the name Black. One night, he gets a phone call from Kevin (Andre Holland) who works as a server and cook at a diner and he asks Chiron to come and visit him in Miami. Kevin also apologizes to Chiron for his unthinkable actions in the school yard which drove Chiron to revenge and hit Terrel in the back. Chiron first comes to a drug treatment facility where his drug-addict mother now resides. Chiron despises her previous behavior with him but their tense conversation comes to a pleasing conclusion when he tearfully forgives her.Chiron finally comes to Miami to visit Kevin and he admits that he's never been in relationship with another person. Kevin was the only person Chiron ever thought about because he's intimately gay. All three actors (Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders and Trevante Rhodes) who play Chiron in three different time periods are terrific in habiting this one role and familiar supporting actors Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris give extraordinary, Oscar-worthy performances as the crack dealer who cares for little Chiron and the crack-addict mother who ignores and mostly abuses Chiron.""Moonlight"" reminded me a lot of ""Boyhood"" because it tells another slice-of-life story in America and it's told in three separate dramatic stages. Writer and director Barry Jenkins (Medicine for Melancholy) who adapts from Tarell Alvin McCraney's critically acclaimed play ""In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue"" doesn't hold anything back or make a false move. He tackles the difficulties of dealing with loneliness and cultural sexually in a way that's universal and remarkably authentic.Deeply moving, sad, brilliant and great all around, I cannot recommend it any higher.",5
"  One unfortunately miscast and misscripted film. All is believable untilChiron grows up. Parts 1 and 2 are great but the massive belly flop of part 3 extinguishes the votive candles lit up till then. What's happened to the dream deferred, the promise of this film? I mean, do you really think a tough guy dealer couldn't manage to find a sexual partner of some sort in all those years? So this script manages to perpetuate the myth of gay male passivity. The writer didn't really know where to go with the script in Part 3. His decision traps the movie in the very homophobia, in-the-closetness that it purports to denounce. It's a movie that stays deep in the closet. No pride here. On the down low from A to Z which is pretty sad but just right for Hollywood. Casting Trevante Rhodes in the role of the adult Chiron is the central error of this film, no longer a sensitive thoughtful man but now a smug, narcissistic, muscle clad hunk who no doubt spends every leisure moment lifting weights. He does not manage to project a conflicted personality. No edginess. From Chris Rock to The Rock physically. The character's transition is simply not credible or emotionally coherent. Perhaps another actor might have pulled it off. But the choice of Trevante Rhodes cements the fundamental flaw in this script, an emotional disconnect between the parts so that all young and adult Chiron have in common is their ethnicity. When I told a Black female friend about this movie, she said she didn't want to hear about it it due to its subject. She is a mother of a young boy. This brought home to me the pathos and truth of this subject, the heavy, suffocating lid that societies put on same sex sexual attraction.",2
"  I know that Moonlight is ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" of movies, and you're not supposed to say anything bad about it, but the emperor is naked and this movie is terrible. It's a completely pretentious and horribly tedious film in both structure and content. This feels like a student film, only not as enjoyable. The Academy got it wrong -- this should not be a Best Picture winner.",1
"  Way overrated, certainly not worth a certified fresh rating.",1
"  Moonlight (Barry Jenkins (III), 2016) - 10/10",5
  It's a real unfolding journey of a boy to a man with bumps and bruises and love in unexpected places along the way!,5
  Moonlight is arguably one of the best films of the year that has a plot that is told by visuals even if the ending can be at first confusing. 100%,5
"  Haunting and beautiful, told with skillful visual storytelling, and wonderfully layered, subtle performances.",4
  Not as good as I thought it would be. Very slow. Would've loved to see more of Mahershala Ali.,1
  Really really well done. Well deserving of best picture,5
  Never quite sure where they were going with this film. Quite disturbing. Not what I expected and don't know how it won Best Picture,2
"  Interesting movie, but not great or groundbreaking or even really touching.",4
"  Moonlight isn't just your typical LGBT movie (I'd even say the LGBT aspects of the movie are overstated as it also focuses on racism and the harsh living environment the protagonist lives in. There's a reason why it's M18 and not R21.) It is a worthy Oscar Best Picture winner because of the great performances and well-written script. My major issue with the film is that it could've been deeper in the plot (I'd say maybe the last third of the movie when it was more boring; albeit a necessary addition to the movie), especially since the movie is not even 2 hours long.",4
"  Moonlight is a drama with a delicate theme set in a difficult situation. We look into 3 parts of the life of Chiron, a boy growing up in the hood and struggling to find himself. Friendship, love and sexuality is the overall focus here, from parental care to first love. It begins when he tries to find a better mother and father role in his life. Second comes the teenager phase and brutal bullying in school, first love and sexual encounter. Last is the part where Chiron is an adult and reconnects with his old friend. We see patterns of his childhood reflected in his own adult life, this is displayed very well. It is a difficult theme and it is paired pretty well with the tough life in the hood, but overall this movie wasn't as good for me as many say. I'd say for me it was more average than extraordinary.",2
  This is the most boring movie I have ever seen.,0
  Beautiful movie with simple visuals. Left a lot of questions unanswered but I guess such is the appeal of the film,4
"  There is very little to this movie and I was very disappointed in it. Basically a boy grows up. He happens to be gay, at least once, and he barely speaks. That's about it. There is no plot other than boy grows up. It's like that movie of a boy's life a few years ago, really nothing happens except everyone ages. It's also full of stereotypes and cliches. When will movie makers do a movie about a girl growing up? We have two now about boys aging into men, let's see some movies about girls becoming women and all the crap we have to go through just to survive. Moonlight is overrated and very depressing.",2
"  A compassionate masterpiece with veins that run red with empathy and humanity. ""Moonlight"" is a story about adolescence, self-discovery, the pains of growing, and the vital importance of compassionate and strong parental roles.One thing that I respect most about this film is the fearlessness found in this film's moments of silence. It's efficient, heavy use of silence that is never without purpose or a function within the narrative.",5
"  Moonlight is quite an interesting one. I wasn't sure what to expect but here is how I felt about the movie.First of all, let's summarize real quick: Moonlight tells the story of an Afro-American from his childhood to his adulthood. The movie is divided in three acts; each of them shows a part of his life. He lives a hard life with his junkie mom.This movie is really slow-paced and it kind of goes nowhere. That's what is beautiful about it. The atmosphere around Chiron (main character) is incredibly heavy, awkward. The endless silences, the way he looks at people, everything will make you feel uncomfortable.The film is also really well made in terms of shooting and the multiple contrasts around the characters made this experience pleasant.The ending is well thought in my opinion: unpredictable yet simple. It brings up debates and that is very enjoyable.I recommend this movie but be patient, as I said, it is extremely slow and ""nothing"" happens during it.",4
  The jewel of the moonlight films,5
"  Damn. A rare and excellent observation of humanity. An intimate film you are probably better off watching alone in order to truly allow yourself to connect with Chiron and the world around him. You feel his love, his frustration, his anger, his loneliness. A well rounded and expertly executed production, no other film this year was better qualified to win the Best Picture Oscar.",5
"  buena, un poco cruda",4
"  MY CREAM-OF-THE-CROP CHOICE for 2016: 'MOONLIGHT'Storytelling, continuity, unpredictability, but the best ingredient ever: the casting. The director chose each of three actors based on their eyes - not their faces. It worked really well. I bathed in this film. It crept under my skin. It ripped my heart out and then placed it back inside my chest but operating just a bit 'better' if you will. Stunning. It really helped that I went into the theater not knowing a thing about the plot - or sub-plot. Like reveling in a good meal with the perfect wine to accompany it, 'Moonlight' just was the best entrée I filled my soul with in the fall of 2016, and it may just be my favorite film ever.",5
"  I like what's behind the courtain: the matrix of the story. But I found it flavorless, with a few peaks of shine. Overrated.",2
"  Absolutely amazing and completely breathtaking, when it ended I was craving more!",5
"  except for the fact the fact it's very realistic and well played, very very regular and nothing that will be remembered one hour after seeing it....",2
  BEST PICTURE 2016: Powerful drama about a black gay man growing up. Chiron goes on a discovery to find who he really is through a troubled upbringing and finding it difficult to fit in at school.,4
"  One of the best films of 2016. ""Moonlight"" is a very moving and inspiring film. Very Highly Recommended!!",5
"  Absolutely riveting. The film may leave you with a lot of questions, but that's a reflection of real life, isn't it? The characters are multidimensional and the performances suberb. I can hardly believe this movie even got made, with the superficial nonsense that we're usually fed at the theatres. Well done!",5
"  I don't get the hype. This movie, like La La Land, is completely forgettable. If this was the best 2016 had to offer (even Suicide Squad walked away with an award), it was indeed a terrible year for movies. Every award should have been given to Kubo and the Two Strings and Zootopia.",1
  A strong storyline with clear message which is engaging throughout. The camera work and use of sound was fascinating. The first 2 acts were great but for me the third act lacked impact.,4
"  Moonlight doesn't feel like a scripted film, it feels real - and has a very important story to tell.",5
  Not a bad movie I wouldn't watch it again but not bad,4
  a good drama. good actors. good storyline. believable. best part filmed in 305. Liberty city represented. and at the last respect and love always wins.,4
  This was a great movie.,5
  Far too slow for my liking ??,2
  Best Movie of the Year....for real...,5
"  9.5/10 The only little flaw I thought was Juan's character, I felt like the film did not explain more of the reason he went from his bad side of town to helping out young Chiron.Moonlight is about the life of Chiron how he has a life with switches of turning events. Chiron starts as a kid that would get picked on by other kids because of his sexual orientation. His mother is a drug addict and he would try to run away to stay with Juan and Theresa who take very good care of him. From there as a kid, Chiron changes phases of growing up while facing the ordeals he has come across with.The film display a lot of development of Chiron's character, it has a lot of meaning in separable ways of life while growing up. Chiron has a friend name Kevin who shows mutual feelings for him too. The changes from his boyhood to teenager to adult were displayed very well from the film. This is the finest story and acting that displays connections to friends and families throughout the film.The soundtrack played smoothly in every part and it calmly transition through scenes. Moonlight definitely deserves that Oscar's choice for best film of 2016. It is remarkable how a this film shows all traits from one focused character.",4
  Phenomenal movie! I had to see what the hype was about. Definitely a must see.,5

  Heartrending and true.,5
"  Moonlight is a spectacular coming of age picture. The soundtrack fits the film and the cinematography is beautiful. Barry Jenkins' long takes are awe-inspiring. The performances are thrilling, all three lads that play Chiron are believable in the stage of his life that they are showing us. Naomi Harris is a different person to what I've ever seen her in. I also really liked Mahershala Ali and Janelle Monáe, who has really made 2016 her breakthrough year, as well as everybody else. This wasn't necessarily relatable for me but I feel that if I was a gay black man, this would really resonate with me.",5
  Moonlight is undoubtedly a cinematic masterpiece.,5
  worth the time.... very good!,4
"  too fragmented lacking connections so didn't know what happened to father figure/drug dealer in beginning...was he in jail, dead? Funeral referenced but he was mentioned later in present tense. Skip 10 yrs what happened after fight at school to living in Atlanta? Also, how did mom go from nurse to crack addict. Best pic should be near perfect or at least a best picture...which to me this was not. Ok at best. Gotta give it up for performances which were great.",1
  Empty and boring. I'm honestly offended this won Best Picture at the Oscars.,1
  A coming of age story from a perspective never seen in film.,5
"  Beautifully made the direction, editing, dialogue, acting, even the soundtrack are all top notch and work together to tell the story of a boy's life, his journey of becoming a man, and discovering who he is.",4
  Did I enjoy La La Land more? Yes. BUT this deserved the W for best picture,5
  This movie won best picture why? Hell or High Water was much better and more entertaining.,2
  This movie was creepy as hell. Wouldn't recommend.,1
"  Why is doing a boring film about some current social issues always seen as brilliant? This is dull. This is like watching a Gus Van Sant film, and not surprisingly it is just as overrated. Just filming a whole bunch of people moping around isn't brilliant.",1
  Boring and waste of time for a straight audience or it just might be only me. I only watched it as it was an Oscar winning movie without knowing about the plot. While it did have good performances I just couldn't connect with the movie.,1
"  sparse and brutal, tense, nerve-wracking and harrowing",4
"  Intimate, haunting, and above all moving; Moonlight is a grand cinematic achievement.",4
  This was a phenomenal movie. I have a hard time sitting through most movies once. I watched this 3 times in a row.,5
  I can't think of one other film that delves into male emotions the way Moonlight does. Most films are about men having guns or skills instead of emotions. Moonlight dares to suggest--gasp!--that a man's emotions are a powerful force in shaping his world. That won this film an Oscar.,4
"  Que gran película, muy bien actuada, y brutalmente narrada, visualmente es grandiosa y la historia es bella en su simpleza.",5
  This is a story of the Lifetime,4
"  This film includes good direction, scoring and cinematography, and stand out performances by Naomi Harris and Ashton Sanders. Despite all of that, and it's relevant and ""important"" subject matter, it is still the movie equivalent of Rohypnol and left no impression on me at all. The bullying scenes were a little too ""after-school special"" and fake, and its snail-like pace really tests the audience. This film will get faux love, genuine love, faux criticism and genuine criticism, so it may be hard to determine if you should go see it. I say, unless you have a particular interest, save your time and money. Lastly, fuck Oscars and their constant insistence of awarding political correctness instead of pure art and movie magic. #LaLaLandteam",2
  Wow Great movie really brings you into the life of the characters you feel every little moment in detail. jus amazing,5
  Loved the movie! It was so well made and the story line was not what I was expecting. Great acting all around!,5
"  For me you can't shake the feeling watching this film that it's garnered such acclaim because it's about a young black homosexual. There's nothing wrong with that obviously, and perhaps that it the film's main importance but it's difficult to then assess the film on it's own feet. There are certainly sections which are extremely moving, particularly the central story of the 3. The film though as a whole is a slight affair, the exceptional performances make you care, but it won't live in the memory for me as a cinematic great.",2
  Routine indie fare - but the social engineers over at the Academy seemed to like it a lot.,2
"  I know it is just me, but I am not interested in depressing movies about people with no character.",0
  A very forgettable movie. Put my wife to sleep and she wasn't tired.,1
"  If you are aware of film, I'm sure you know this won the best picture of the year. So obviously it's a really good movie. It wasn't my personal favorite of the year, but it's definitely in my top ten hands down, probably top five. The acting/ the cast was probably the strongest things about this movie. Everyone acted very well and everything felt very natural. None of it felt like acting, which is a great feat. Mahershala Ali seems to be a really great actor, and I wished I could have seen more of his character. I'll try to watch some more things with him in it. I really liked his portrayal of the villain in Luke Cage. The storytelling in Moonlight was really well done too. I liked that it was split into three different chapters. It didn't really have any of the amazing shots that I like to see in my ""best picture"" films. Movies like Arrival or The Revenant had such great cinematography, and that's important to me. All in all, this was a really good movie though. I think overall, it is a better movie than La La Land, but La La Land is more enjoyable. However, Arrival and Deadpool are still my top two of the 2016 year.",4
"  Incredible story. No glitz, no glam, just the nitty gritty of it all. Incredibly strong cast!",4
"  I had to go back and watch this film a second time. The first time I was upset and how miserable, neglected and lonely a child can be with a drug-addicted mother and how bullies at school tormented him. The acting and filming were so good, a film perfectly cast, that I needed to give it a second try. I'm glad I did.",4
"  Moonlight is a mighty testament to the power of one person's story. It's so sturdy it can be the black, queer, poor answer to a dozen beloved white-centered films -- American Pie, Sixteen Candles, Matilda. That would be enough, but don't make the mistake of assuming its appeal is as narrow as that of most white-centric films. It's also a boldly nonlinear coming-of-age story.",5
  I felt like I was watching a film specifically made to win an Oscar. All the social criteria are there. It is actually a very boring film with a very predicable story line.,1
  A heavy film but unique in both its material and directive style. It is beautiful to look at and scored with powerful music. Pushes forward the genre in a great way.,4
"  I totally went in blind!! Damn it!! Not really into it, the acting was ok but the film was very, very slow. Not sure about all the awards or how this is highly rated.",1
  I cried so much in this movie,4
"  Moonlight felt like a very personal film made with an abundance of care and attention for every detail. The acting is great all around, at parts it's actually quite superb, and the casting I have to say was spot on. With a great soundtrack and a very emotionally touching score I really enjoyed Moonlight. It felt like something different and unique. Since it's a character driven film I found that while Barry Jenkins' directing and the film's cinematography is gorgeous to look at and the script and dialogue feels very authentic, I did not get to know Chiron's character that much during the film, and that definitely took away a lot from his personality and some of the enjoyability for me. This made it a lot harder for me to resonate with Chiron. It seemed to me that Moonlight's focus was at times a bit too much on showcasing the main characters struggles and the supporting characters, while not enough on actually building up an interesting personality for him.",4
  absolute the best picture in 2016 after watching 3 times,4
"  Magnificent story and greatly acted. The mind is left to imagine the ending. That's not what i want, so it felt short, the buildup was tremendous for the ultimate let down.",2
"  Moonlight is not a film, there is no way that was a movie. I am convinced that I just watched real life events play out, that is how good this film is. Moonlight tells a powerful story about a young man trying to figure out what kind of person he really is. I won't spoil the details if you have not seen the film but I will tell you that this film is amazing. The acting is perfect, the directing is perfect, the script is perfect, the score is perfect, everything is perfect. Moonlight was truly an experience, and I would strongly recommend this film to anyone. I think this is a very important movie that everyone needs to see.",5
"  Fascinating, complex",4
  The profanity and ghetto talk didn't offend me; I'm sure they were quite authentic. And the acting was excellent. But the storyline was thin and not the least bit interesting or believable.,2
  Liberal claptrap not worth the time. How this won the golden globe is beyond me. Just not a good film.,1
"  Coming into ""Moonlight"" I had incredibly high expectations, after watching it win multiple oscars, and just seeing the amazing amount of praise it got. I can now say that after watching it, all of that has lived up to the standards, this movie is beautiful. Everything about the way this movie was shot was wonderfully done, the scenes were set up so that you could really capture how rough the environment that Chiron grew up in was. The acting was absolutely astonishing, especially by all three Chirones; Alex R. Hibbert (Young Chirone), Ashton Sanders (Teen Chirone), and Trevante Rhodes (Adult Chirone), all three of them, plus pretty much everyone else in this movie contributed greatly to the quality of the movie. The pacing was also very well done in this movie, every scene held importance, however I feel like they had the opposite problem that most movies have, instead of going on too long, ""Moonlight"" almost goes too short, as I feel as though some parts to the story go unanswered, because the main focus of the story is on Chirone and his life, however I would've liked to see some of the subplots surrounding the side characters tie up completely, and I don't feel as though that happened. Still, though, ""Moonlight"" deserves all the praise it gets, and is most definitely among the top movies of 2016, and is definitely worth the watch.",4
"  ""It's a film that's a film,"" or in other words thereâ< are no words that can properly describe it. If you want to know more you should probably watch it.",4
"  Moonlight is one of those rare films that, in terms of dialogue, less is more, and it works beautifully from start to finish. The performances are grandly intelligent, and each character feels genuinely pure rather than written. This is what real cinema is.",4
  Nowhere near the hype,1
  Fairly slow and boring. Can't possibly see how this won the Oscar. Politics? La La Land was infinitely better.,2
  A clever structure of switching actors to follow the lead characters from childhood to adult. An honest and vulnerable journey through growing up with an addicted parent and the examination of teenage sexual desire.,4
  I think moonlight is one of he best LGBT movies I've seen. As a non straight black person its relatable. Having to hide who you truly are and waiting to be comfortable is a struggle and it's like the movie tells us we aren't alone. Chiron is a super relatable character in more ways than one. The only thing I didn't like is the beach scene. Too instant.,4
  How this movie got good reviews is beyond me!,0
"  Even though it displays great performances (with Mahershala Ali standing out), an unique sense of realism and one fine cinematography and explores life itself, with all that it entails, along with numerous themes (growing up, racial discrimination, homosexuality, drug addiction, morality, family issues, and more) through the eyes of black people, ""Moonlight"" will definitely satisfy critics and cinema professionals but, for a film whose message is intended to reach all audiences, in spite of its all-black casting, it tries too much in just 110 minutes and loses itself in a three-part product that feels too short (and at the same time, too long, since the overall pace is quite slow) and inefficiently developed, for any average or unexperienced viewer will hardly empathize with any character or any situation, and will be left searching for an epic-scale film that does not exist.",2
  Amazingly intriguing and real,5
  totally not the best picture this year,1
"  Amazing. Love the plot, though sometimes things were hard to follow, but other than that the film was a powerful explanation of life in black communities in the US.",4
  The best 2016 has to offer. It's tough to watch but shows aspects of life a lot of people don't get to see.,5
  ANY & EVERY OTHER movie released last year should've won the Oscar over this waste of time! I did not enjoy Moonlight one bit! It's the only movie in my IM DB Check-in's that I've rate 1-star and I only signed up for RottenTomatoes so I can cast my half-of-a-star voice disappointment. Moonlight is just terrible!,0
  Just not good at all,1
  i can't believe it win!! i didn't like it at all!!,2
"  Without a doubt deserves film of the year. The cinematography, thematic presence, and overall story have me at a loss for words. Truly a remarkable film.",5
  Intriguing due to the subject.,4
"  A well paced drama that takes you down an unfamiliar road of sexuality, dysfunctional family life and reputation vs personal choice. The cinematography is superb and acting carries the film. Haunting and a soul searching tale of a young man seeking emotional comfort.",4
  It deserved best picture,5
  A Good Film but Not Oscar Worthy. It was hard to tell if Chiron was just socially awkward or had a mental disorder. Not until late in the film do you understand what's going on with his character. Mahershala Ali was great though. I would have liked to see more done with him in the film.,2
  Provocatively original and poetic!,5
"  For me just an average movie with an important life story involved. Shows the double struggle of growing up by being black and on top of that being gay. At times it was tough to watch the maing characters struggles, but a movie that tells the story decently. For me I saw this movie because of all the obvious hype, and agree that the acting was over the top, but all through the movie seemed like something was missing that I can't quite put my finger on!",2
"  ""Moonlight' was easily one of the slowest most un thought provoking Films of the year. But in saying this ""Moonlight"" did have some nice character moments, especially in the first half. The Plot to ""Moonlight"" is A timeless story of human self-discovery and connection, Moonlight chronicles the life of a young black man from childhood to adulthood as he struggles to find his place in the world while growing up in a rough neighbourhood of Miami. The Direction by ""Barry Jenkins"" I found to be very choppy at times by having no idea what he wanted to do with what he had. I could tell by watching the film (especially in the second half) that he didn't know how to show these characters as being likeable, had no idea how to skip time periods and didn't know what to put in the final cut of the film and what not to put in. Which brings me onto the editing. The editing in this film I found super hard to keep up with and is one of the main reasons there where so many plot holes. The Acting in this I found to be really good, one of the only great things about this film in my opinion. The main standouts for me where ""Mahershala Ali"" and ""Janelle Monáe"". Even though these two actors had minimal time on screen they made the most of their screen time and where super believable. The Characters in this film where all over the place. The main protagonist being Alex who you see grow on screen. This character I found to be very annoying at times and then slightly likeable at other times. The character that I thought was the most believable and likable was Teresa, this is mainly caused by ""Janelle Monáe"" doing a great job in her role but the screenplay also helped as well. Speaking of the screenplay, I found it to be atrociously written at many points. With some major plot holes and not knowing what happened to many characters one main example being Juan. The Score composed by ""Nicholas Britell"" was exceptionally composed and worked perfectly with the film. One of the biggest issues I had with ""Moonlight"" was the pacing. The pacing had huge issues with it being way too slow in the second half. I'm majorly surprised I made it through the whole film. The first half of the film had an okay, it was still slow at times but it was watchable. But once it got into the third act, the film just put on its brakes and went to a full on halt. Although one scene I did like from the film was when the main protagonist Alex was with a supporting character Juan at a beach and Juan was teaching Alex to swim. I found that scene to have a big impact on the character and moved the story along well. Overall I found ""Moonlight"" to have some good character moments, excellent acting from two supporting roles ""Mahershala Ali"" and ""Janelle Monáe"", and an excellent score that went perfectly with the film. Although it did have major issues with the pacing in the second half, chopping directing, a few annoying characters, a screenplay that was horribly written and horrific editing. I give 2016's ""Moonlight"" a 5/10.",2
  Quite possibly the worst movie ever to win any award much less Best Picture. What a joke and just shows how out of touch from reality Hollywood really is.,0
  boring boring boring. another movie you have to say how in the world did it win an Oscar.,2
"  Heartbreaking and tender. Powerful performances by the entire cast, including the kids at the start. Well worth the watch, and well deserving of every Oscar they received.",4
  Didn't really like it,2
  He described the American Society in one of it's sides perfectly!,5
  Worst movie I have seen in a long time - Absolutely NOTHING HAPPENS! 2 hours wasted time I will never get back! My wife and a couple of co-workers agree - If there were minus stars available this movie would get a few.,0
  great movie I can see how it won best picture,4
  Every actor in this film deserves an Oscar! Casting was excellent. I never once felt that anyone was reading a script. Sensitive material extremely well done.,5
  Very Booooring..... I watched pushing the fast forward button every 5 minutes.,0
  Pelicula totalmente irrelevante y sin buena historia,0
"  This movie doesn't not focus on making a point. It simply tells a story of a person, and his life. There are no flash-back sequences, or moral lessons. Why it won an Oscar is beyond me, but most of the theatre left wondering 'what the fuck'? Nonetheless, if you like a movie with no obligation to prove a point, then this is for you. It's good, but missing that emotional hook we are used to with hollywood-style movies.",4
"  After all the hype and the glowing praise, and yes it's a stunning visual meditation on identity, violence, and reconciliation but it's very difficult not to be overwhelmed by the inherent homophobia and the downplayed erotics of it.. a little step for gay black men but still a lot to go. The film stripped bare any erotic semblance and drowned any notion of desire in the pathos of emotional trauma of black violence and homophobia. There could not have been two characters unsexed as these two. Even if the film was an emotional and visual triumph I still cannot overcome such absence or willful omission. Heterosexual or not, the director and actors should have known better.",4
"  IDK...just seems all the ""Oscar"" nominated movies were so sad this year... :(",2
"  Great movie in showing what some go through in day to day life growth, challenges and change. Drama, suspenseful at times, several wow moments and several aww moments. I'd watch it again ????",5
  Dragged in a little bit but this is a story of a situation I haven't even considered before let alone watched.,4
  I see why it won an award ????,5
  Outstanding and touching!,5
"  Moonlight compels me to give it 5 stars. Upon finishing the film, I didn't really understand completely what I had just witnessed, it's definitely one of the most provokingly sensitive and probing looks in at an anonymous character's existence and the details that frame his perspective are so distinct and delicate that it's charming throughout. Moonlight is incredibly tragic and a film that feels needed in the LGBT community as well as the general film community. Both independent and inclusive, Moonlight is fascinating, marvellously acted and generously proportioned in both feeling and thought. It's definitely a film that is hard to describe and the brilliant acting capabilities from all three men who play the title character are breathtaking and so so haunting that the film stays with you long after it ends. I can't say if it fully deserved the Best Picture Oscar this year as I haven't seen the other entrants, however it is definitely deserving of any praise that it receives.",6
  a bit heavy but still a good movie,4
  I regret the time I wasted watching this movie,0
  A very thought provoking film. Well written and acted.Lots of uncomfortable silences throughout the film that force your mind into thinking for yourself.,4
"  Gay stories are severely lacking in cinema and when gay characters do exist, they're rarely done justice, commonly portrayed as sidekicks or stereotypes. But Moonlight, by indie African American director Barry Jenkins, is an extraordinary coming of age drama that lays the struggles of one gay man front and centre, while asking difficult and open ended questions about the nature of masculinity and sexuality in African American culture, issues rarely explored on the big screen.The story, based on Tarell Alvin McCraney's play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue, chronicles the life of a young black man from childhood to adulthood as he struggles to find his place in the world growing up in 'da hood'. It is a heartbreaker of a film, incredibly moving and of staggering depth and subtlety, a coming of age drama both specific in its subject while universal in its theme.The narrative has a triptych structure. Across three moments in the life of its main character, Chiron (played by three different actors), it communicates how difficult it is if you are black and gay in a community in which masculinity is strictly defined and demanded.This story of an impoverished life of a young, gay black American is full of powerful performances from its cast. The style of the film demands that much is conveyed with no dialogue and its extraordinary performances meet the challenge.Trevante Rhodes and Mahershala Ali are both outstanding, and it's a stunning turn by André Holland. The film is also dazzling, visually intoxicating cinema, sensually and mesmerically shot. It has incredible flow moving easily between the desperate events without ever seeming merely episodic. A symphony in three acts, Moonlight is at once a vital portrait of contemporary African American life and an intensely personal and poetic mediation on gay identity, family, friendship and love. Moonlight is a sublime achievement and a groundbreaking piece of cinema. And a richly deserved awards winner.",5
  Very disappointing after the reviewers hype. It may be a sensitive story but over long and dull. Did not deserve the oscar counting figures and la la land were much better.,2
"  Maravillosa, emocionante, todos los Oscars de los últimos años se merece.",5
  This was a great cinema experience but left thinking there was too much imagery (water etc) and not enough plot. At times more like a piece of art than a film. Call me a heathen.,4
  WEAKEST FIGHT SCENE EVER!!! LOL Really slow moving and boring movie. Me no like,1
  Amazing movie that covers so many subjects. Every actor that played the lead role was very good. The movie as a whole presented as very vulnerable,5
  This is a good movie. Cant find a flaw with it.,4
"  This poetic film that chronicles three stages in the life of a black kid (eventually teen and adult in each respective chapter) who struggles in his coming of age, dealing with his addict mother as well as his own sexual identity. It's a well made, and subtle, film that grapples with it's subject matter with maturity and beauty and sorrow.",4
  Extremely boring and disappointing for and oscar winning film. Good story but could not get any connection with main character as he was so dry and emotionless.,1
"  Raw, powerful and emotional. The acting really made the audience feel the desperation and hopelessness of growing up in that environment.",4
  Best movie I've seen in years! It was moving. Beautiful portrayal of nurturing masculinity. You will fall in love with this movie.,5
  Strong performances and hypnotic cinematography bring to life a film about self-discovery.,4
  Phenomenal. The closest thing to a masterpiece that I have seen in the past year.,4
  OPERATIC BEAUTY AND SADNESS,4
"  Even though Moonlight is a very very sad and touching movie, it still has no such kind of meaningful meaning, watching a few guys having a bad and miserable life doesn't show us anything useful. Highly Overrated!. Not Best Picture quality.",1
  Boring. Can't trust critics rating. Never trust what the oscars say about movies. Waste of time watching this movie.,0
  Saw the movie after it won Best Picture. Is it a good film? Yes. Is it the best film I saw out of all that was in the category? No. However it is a good story and I did enjoy Ali's performance.,4
  a thoughtful black gay romance. winner indeed.,4
  Nothing clever to say here. This is a great movie. A meaningful and honest movie. Both brutal and beautiful. Watch it. Just watch it.,5
  Still trying to find out how this won awards. Very disappointing movie.,0
"  A film not overly obsessed with dialogue but instead setting a mood with music and visuals; allowing the audience to see things as the protagonist is seeing and feeling things. Moonlight is not only a story for a gay audience to relate too but also for anyone who has experienced bullying, family struggles, minorities, growing pains, and life mistakes and struggles. A beautiful film that if given a chance can make us all feel a bit more compassionate and understanding towards the differences of others.",5
"  I can't believe this won best picture. Started off good but worsened as it went on, only to find this movie is a story about a gay man...smh disappointed.",1
  Definitely one of the Oscar front runners. Was a little slow at times and the ending could have been more seamless. Still one of the best of 2016. The acting was phenomenal.,5
  What a snooze-fest. Yawn!!!,0
  Barry Jenkins most certainly makes a name for himself. The drama takes its time while maintaining a watchable pace. Feels like a film the indie boom of the '90s forgot to include.,4
"  A gripping and emotive story which moves quickly enough to ensure the audience are not left wanting for more 'action' from the, otherwise, fairly dry storyline. Excellent soundtrack, fantastic acting performances from all incarnations of the protagonist.",5
"  This was a very boring movie, depressing and too dark, too many Long lingering head shots, I couldn't wait to leave the cinema....!!! Save yourself 10 bucks DON'T GO..",0
  stunning film! beautiful color tones & music.,5
"  This movie was even better than I hoped, even though I didn't see it until the buzz had built up my expectations for quite some time.",5
"  A beautifully deep, authentic movie. Gorgeous film, expertly acted. Provoking. Mahershala Ali is a superb actor -- and this is some of his most honest work. Which is saying something.",5
  Movie sucks! How the hell it won a Oscar beats me! Smdh,1
  Everything Boyhood wanted to be but better,4
  confusing just like the characters in the movie,1
"  it earns its best picture win with strong performances, and an understanding of its characters without judgement. Powerful from beginning to end.",5
"  This hands down, has to be one of the worst films I have ever watched. It will be the last time I ever watch a film based on the Tomatometer rating alone. It had little or next to no compelling, interesting story whatsoever. It was edgy, you don't know what is going to happen and you're waiting for something bad to happen, in the end nothing at all happened. Absolute load of rubbish.",1
  An amazing perspective of a person who grew up in an environment that doesn't understand and tries to bury the feeling that person has. Story like this can be applied to many other situations all around the world and doesn't have to be about being gay or black it can be about anyone who is forced to changed because of the surroundings.,4
  Disappointing. The most boring Oscar winner I've ever watched. @valeriacoelhochutrau #boring,0
"  Everything, that's wrong with today's world rolled into one is this atrocity winning ""Best Picture"". It seems, that everyone has forgotten, what ""cinema"" is about.",0
  We watched this last night and it was an interesting drama about the struggles of some people.,4
  Not really sure what all the fuss was about,2
"  Moonlight's excellent structure in storytelling, its powerful performances and thematic vision really emphasizes the film's sense of self-discovery. A unique presentation, filled with a superb use of music, colors, cinematography, and combined with its sheer drama makes this a monumentally notable tale of a lifetime that audiences can empathize with. 4/5",5
"  Moonlight was a challenging yet important task for the film industry- it confronted difficult social situations and brought light to the complex and confusing times of adolescence. Its attention to nuance both in script and in cinematography was what made the movie the large success that it was. Additionally, It was an especially important moment for African Americans in film, as it offered many important roles (and subsequent award nominations) to this minority, as they empowered the black identity as well as the homosexual identity- important on their own, and at their intersection.Katherine Fox, May 2017Freeman School of Business/ Tulane University",5
"  Pacing really hurts this one, loved Ali's acting but other than that a movie that doesn't try enough to make you feel the pain of the main character. I was disappointed, don't know how this film beat the likes of Hidden Figures, Fences, or La La Land.",2
"  I didn't really want to see this film, but after it won picture of the year, I figured I had to give it a try. Yes the performances are great, and the cinematography is beautiful, but besides that, I could not get invested in the story. It seems so many of the award winning films have too many slow moving scenes and are not movies I would want to watch again.",2
  So boring. I had to watch it at 2X speed to make it through. I can't understand all the hype for this movie. The Oscar definitely should have gone to Deadpool.,1
"  I did not want to buy into the Oscar hype, but this was a really good movie. I know the basic plot going in. Closeted gay black man's life in three phases of his life. It was very well written and acted. I agree with Mahershala Ali's Oscar win. He has been one of my favorite actors already but the scene when he is asked if he was a drug dealer......Yo!!! Powerful. This is the second movie I have watched recently that showed a life I pitied. Definitely worth checking out.",4
"  Moonlight is directed and written by Barry Jenkins, and it stars Trevante Rhodes, André Holland, Janelle Monáe, Naomie Harris, and Mahershala Ali in a coming-of-age drama about the three stages of life from Chiron which are from the time when he was a little kid, teenager, and adult in terms of his sexual identity and what he has to deal with. For my third film in the Academy Awards approach, I decide to watch this next because when I first heard of this, I didn't take notice to it without even knowing what it's about, and when it starts getting high positive reviews which ended up getting Best Picture from Academy Awards, got me very curious about it and decide to rent it. Turns out, I understand why it got Best Picture as it rightfully deserves it. The three actors that played Chiron which are Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders, and Trevante Rhodes are superb in this as they both give their different versions of the character, but still manage to have the same spirit of the same character, which makes it interesting to know that the director didn't want any of the actors for Chiron to meet each other after filming is done so that they don't imitate each other. Naomie Harris did a fantastic job being a drug addict that doesn't appreciate his son that I'm glad to see her get some recognition, even Mahershala Ali who was not in it that much, but still left an impact on the film that I'm glad that he won an Oscar for it. The three stories of Chiron's life are equally so investing to watch of how this kid is going through his sexual identity when he doesn't know how to deal with it, which her mother doesn't help with the situation, and is very well-written by Barry Jenkins. The cinematography by James Laxton is well done that the shots have purpose of the scenes that it's showing. The score by Nicholas Britell is beautiful with the violin scenes, and when there's is an actual song, it fits with the scene, and it doesn't feel like it's a way to get a paycheck out of it. I didn't really know where it's leading, especially when it gets to the next story, and the way it's portrayed in this in terms of coming-of-age films, it's quite special and very refreshing in its way that does it a bit similarly to Boyhood, but puts the character in a horrible situation in the slums. There are great moments that are just satisfying to watch multiple times, and the diner scene is really heartfelt and natural that you felt like you were there with him after all the things that he had to go through. Moonlight is a masterpiece that I'm glad I got to notice Barry Jenkins as a director/writer and can't wait to see him do his next film that's about The Underground Railroad.",5
"  Slow, overlong and predictable. Acting was top notch but could not sustain my interest to the end. No idea why it has been getting such amazing reviews.",2
"  If I could rate this movie with negative stars I would. This is the epitome of a movie that is a darling of the critics and simply falls flat for most viewers. My wife quit less than a third of the way through it. A movie to me is used to educate, entertain and make you feel. This simply plodded along for an hour and fifty minutes with not much to offer.",0
"  This movie is shout out to rid the #Oscarsowhite hashtag. Not to take away from the movie, it probably was not best movie deserving. The acting was powerful and the art of storytelling was sincere to a fault. Character development was fantastic. But the movie lacked innovation in filmmaking and I wasn't too happy with the handheld camera work.",4
  Excellent film!! Great acting!,4
"  Amazing movie. Really conveys an amazing message, or more like a reminder. Life is not always how we imagine it and Barry Jenkins shows us an amazing story. One that could be happening out there today, right now. It blows your mind in ways. Also, must add that it was such a pleasure to watch this film. Makes me believe cinematography is not dead...we need more movies like this. The scenes were amazing, lighting was awesome and the music choices are on point too. Moments of silence in the movie spoke louder thn any monologue or dialogue I've seen. Thank you Mr. Jenkins.",5
  not much really happens and not very groundbreaking. hugely overrated but still better than La La Land.,2
  We just saw Moonlight and were very disappointed. Not the best film of the year. Both La La Land and Manchester By ThSeacwere far better! Was the fix in at the Oscars?,0
  Beautifully done ! (No homo),4
  Naome Harris (the drug addicted mother) and Mahershala Ali (the drug dealer) were awesome. I just wished the writers had kept them in the second half of the movie. Instead the producers concentrate more on the relationship between the two guys. Boring as hell. I fell asleep.,2
"  My opinion---I can already say that I discovered a magnificent film if any, I really liked this film and the depth that it released felt it all along on a subject how often worked, Barry Jenkins ""Médecine pour Mélancolie- (2008)"" might have fallen into the cartoon, but he did very well with this beautiful dramatic story, divided into three parts: childhood, adolescence and adulthood. This film also denounces the wickedness of young people to the difference and the impact they will have on their lives, and Moonlight will not deviate from the rule: a violent father, a prostitute mother and finally the drug and Violence to crown it all. When you read these adjectives, you will quickly understand in what atmosphere the film will lead you, you transpose this one to two young black Americans, you will tie the whole with a great friendship between these two personages who will pass through the childhood, the adolescence And then the adulthood, the whole will be carried out in a great complicity and a great modesty. The realization of Barry Jenkins is perfect, the scenario although already folded is nevertheless superb, the proof, it obtained the oscar of the The three actors who play the respective roles of childhood to adulthood are wonderful in their interpretation and give even more depth to the film. The images are absolutely magnificent and the shots are chosen with great accuracy. Moreover, he has made a magnificent atmosphere to the film, which makes it even stronger, it is a powerful work and will not spread But by marrying all these sets that will make this film beautiful, there is of course a position on the subject of sexuality (homosexuality itself) but the subject is treated with great modesty and this Film will be even more beautiful having been treated this way by Barry Jenkins. To finally arrive at the music of the film, wonderful and which will accompany each emotion in the film: ""The Middle of the World"" by Nicholas Britell (Moonlight Soundtrack). In conclusion: I can say that I discovered a magnificent film with incredible emotions, saying that it deserved the Oscar in relation to ""La La Land"" there, I'm sure, but I also loved, "" You will not kill ""and"" Fences ""two who would have largely earned the Oscar for best film. This is a wonderful film that I advise to see for all the positives detailed in my review",4
"  Naomi's Harris is absolutely stunning, what I don't understand is how did Mahershala Ali win a Oscar for only being in the film for 25 minutes and yet I don't even know how he die. Moonlight is just about what people of color that lives though poverty has to go through. Especially being a person of color that is gay, you will go through a lot. I give credit to Barry Jenkins who did a great job directing the film. Hopefully this is a life lesson, no matter who you are, the color of your skin, don't give up. Life goes on and it is okay to be LGBT because that is who we identify as now.",4
"  Moonlight was one of the best films I've seen in a while! They took the time to develop the characters, and I really enjoyed the story. The acting was also superb! It was different and refreshing!Some people walked out the movie during certain scene, and that was distracting, but it's their loss. They missed out on an excellent movie!",5
  Beautifully shot with a story that shows a side of the society we normally don't see. Truly deserving of the best film academy award.,5
"  Moonlight builds its main subject with substance-filled chapters, acted by brilliant and compelling actors, in a rare fascinating story while dealing with difficult issues, race and sexuality, while fighting the pressures of life.This is Director Barry Jenkins' first Oscar Award winning piece, but before this, he's already known for his style, for he fills the silver screen with detailed masterpieces apart from it being visually captivating. He doesn't do movies for the visual pleasures, there's always a story behind every angle of his film.Moonlight is divided into three chapters, all with the lead being performed by three different actors whom all provided a soul to their character, Chiron.The first part is titled ""Little"", which entails Chiron's isolation as a kid, for different reasons like bullying and his mother being a crack addict. The second called ""Chiron"" where, in his adolescent years, began to question or be curious of his sexuality, and still the bullies in school that made his inner beast came to life.

  waste of my life I can't get back,0
"  This movie sucks and so does Hollywood's opinion of a great movie. Made it about fifteen minutes before I wanted to rip my own face off out. Can't help but to think they were awarded best picture for their race. In any case, cheers to you for your award but your movie is horrible.",1
  Looking forward to seeing this movie. Waited a long time for it to play in our area. What a disappointment. Can't believe it won best picture.,0
"  2.5/5 stars. This movie told an important story, but I'm not sure it translated that well from the play to the film. It was very slow and just when a storyline would pick up and get interesting, then the plot would shift to a new time period and slow down to a crawl again.",2
  A theatrical experience,5
  Execellent movie!!!!!,5
  what a beautiful movie...confusing and sensible at the same time. nothing like anything I've ever seen and will be hard-pressed to experience something like it again sadly.,5
"  I am not just reviewing this movie because it won the Oscar a few weeks ago, even if that is one reason. ""Moonlight"" is a wonderful film that is a coming of age story about an African-American man who is bullied for being gay. It is hard to describe the plot in a sentence or two, but I can tell you the movie is told in three different parts, one as a kid, teen and a grown man. The boy's name is Chiron, and his mother(like many at the time) was a crack-addict and would never give Chiron the love he needed. Chiron, as a young boy, met a friendly drug dealer and his girlfriend, who are the only ones sharing affection with him. The dealer, Juan, and his girlfriend take care of him by feeding him, and letting him spend the night on occasions. As he grows up, Chiron gets bullied even more, and it almost seems as everything gets worse. Having trouble with his identity, he meets a troublemaker named Kevin who actually has feelings for him, and they experience sexuality. But of course, there are always more conflicts for him to experience. When a grown man, he becomes someone else, not who the real, ""little"" Chiron is. ""Moonlight"" is a hard movie to watch at many parts, including the second act. It is also hard to relate to these characters, bullied, black, gay and surrounded by drugs. The real reason why this movie is so emotional, so captivating is because of the incredible performances by ALL, and the WONDERFUL directing from Barry Jenkins. I left this movie crying, because at the end it's almost like a fill in the blank, you have to understand from what Chiron has gone through, and how he turns out. Many people dislike this movie, to be mean towards black people, and I assure you, if no one told me or you this had an all-black cast, you wouldn't notice. Rated R.",5
  This move was awful! Might be the worst movie I've ever seen. What was the point of this movie??? To find out the kid likes men. The story line sucked!!!,0
  One of the best movies of all time.,5
"  The story is compelling, painting a picture of lives in struggle against strong themes. The musical score envelopes the story and brilliantly heightens the emotion of scenes. In spite these things and strong, gripping performances by the actors, the movie falls victim to itself and incredibly slow pacing.",2
  /A-/ An extremely well-crafted film. Deserving of the praise it is receiving.,4
  La La Land got robbed. This movie is really just not that interesting.,1
"  I found it slow in parts and a little predictable, although I liked the edginess of the main character and the acting was believable.",2
"  A movie about life, growing up, but above all, defining yourself. It revolves around what Juan says : ""At some point, you gotta decide for yourself who you're going to be. Can't let nobody make that decision for you.""",4
"  Moonlight is a powerful and beautiful metaphorical film about identity and intense human emotion. It allows you to enter and follow a life that many have never considered living. The plot is very tasteful and mature, the acting is superb all around, and the cinematography is exquisite - enough to form empathy, understanding, and art. Rating: 8.1/10",4
  This movie is a horrible waste of your valuable time. Makes me want the last 3 hours of my life back.,0
  A poignant and heartbreaking story of love and growing up told from a perspective we haven't seen a lot in movies.,5
  Highly Disappointed. Not worth spending your time on this movie.,0
"  Well shot, but overrated. I don't mind a human story but nothing barely happens here.",2
  A realistic eye opening view on the life in the inner city and how you're treated if you're different.,6
"  Utter rubbish!!! Including travel time, that was 2.5 hours of my life I wish I could get back!!!",0
"  Berührendes & inszenatorisch sehr intimes Außenseiterporträt über Erwartungen, Menschlichkeit und Vorurteile.",4
  Best rim I've seen in a long time brilliant acting,5
"  Well, this is probably one of the most overhyped films I've come across. The premise is excellent and it could have really pushed a lot of boundaries, but the whole experience was just shallow. For a film based solely off the idea of a character study, the character in question was just flat-out boring. There was no depth to him at all at any of the three stages of his life. Making a character gay and having that as the main premise doesn't make a character interesting, but even the handling of his sexual orientation was rubbish. There was no commentary on it whatsoever, and there wasn't even any chemistry between him and the man he was supposed to be in love with. With a film broaching deep topics such as a growing up black slums amongst crime, with an abusive parental upbringing and being beaten around for being gay, the film just tip toes through these things without offering any real breadth. It never gets its hands dirty. Oh, and the ending was just plain shocking. You sit through two and a half hours of a character study and the film won't even give a proper conclusion to the character in question? Terrible. 2 stars because the cinematography was interesting, as was the music.",2
"  An ordinary story of a poor black boy growing up and fallen into crime. no plot, no great scenes or moral... NOT THE MOVIE OF THE YEAR...",2
  A beautiful film that portrays a much needed story in today's society that is still quite overhyped. Felt far too short considering the subject matter and story plays it a little loose & safe. Wish it just offered..... more.,4
  Negative 5 review. Horrible movie!,1
  Enjoyable. The story drew me in and I liked seeing him change as he grew up. I was a little disappointed in the ending but overall a good picture.,2
"  This movie really choked me up at the end, but it hit me most about 30 minutes later after I processed more of what had happened. I feel like the movie was beautiful and sad. Seeing how Chiron abandoned himself and transformed himself to fit a certain image in chapter 3 just really killed me. The other thing I noticed was with Kevin's character in chapter two with how he allowed his peers and his situation to shape his identity. You're doing yourself a disservice if you don't check this out.",4
"  Beautiful photography, great acting and casting. Hard and soulful at the same time. A story that needed to be told.",5
  I really lover this film. It was beautifully filmed and so well acted. Such a poignant display of love and conflict.,4
"  TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE: TERRIBLE....Academy awards got this SOOOOOO wrong.",0
  How did this even get nominated?,0
"  There is a lyrical quality about 'Moonlight'. The central character, Chiron, grows from young boy to young man in a pool of loneliness. He changes and changes himself externally but remains the same inside. Do we all remain, essentially, who we have become by the time we are twelve? A good film. Watch it.",5
"  Moonlight disappointed me, primarily because it could easily have been a much better movie Director Barry Jenkins takes the main character, Terence, beyond brooding, alienated, and painfully withdrawn... all the way to boring. We were deprived of Best Supporting Actor Oscar winner Mahershala Ali's outstanding acting only 10-20% of the way through the story and - along with it - an abrupt end to the first of many story lines. The cast (other than Ali) did not provide compelling performances, too many ideas and characters were never developed, and perhaps the only truly unique twist to the central theme was that the main character was gay. Even many influences of the latter were never well-explored.Taken together, these are the main reasons why I thought Moonlight was an interesting concept and story, but could have been a much better movie.By way of comparison, my standard reference for the theme of Black children coping with desperate inner city environments, devoid of hope, is the 1994 film ""Fresh"". We could quibble about differences in details between the two movies, but everyone from the writers to the director to a young Sean Nelson (supported by Samuel L. Jackson and others) did a better job than did their Moonlight counterparts. Fresh - as a story - certainly had at least one distinct advantage. Unlike Moonlight, which ended with a quasi-cliche sense that a kid with Terence's reality will become a victim of his environment (except for the resolution of his long suppressed homosexuality), Fresh offered a very interesting perspective on how a kid might be able to do better than that... even if he cannot escape his environment.I do not understand how Moonlight could have been voted Best Picture because, not only do I think it was not, I do not consider it even among the best 2016 films focused on the lives of African Americans.Fresh was ahead of its time and - for what it is worth - if both films had been released in 2016, I believe far more Best Picture Oscar votes would have been garnered by Fresh than Moonlight.",0
  Superbly directed and acted.Wasn't expecting the mid plot. Did slow down at the end but overall very good and a worthy winner of best picture oscar.,4
"  sorry but when something wins best picture it must live up to high expectations, and for me this movie just didn't. It dealt with really controversial themes and there was some really good acting. However this was just a boring movie and I feel it's rating is more political than anything. Come back in ten years time and it won't have the legs.",0
  Best Movie..sad subject....but well acted and directed...,5

"  Well done, surprised the kid was not nominated for awards.",4
  Shocked that this movie won the Oscar. Not at all impressed.,2
"  I don't know this movie won best picture, it was total caca. And Mahershala Ali winning best supporting actor? he was the worst actor to ever play a ""Cuban"" in my life. Hollywood threw a bone this year to make people stop boycotting their shows, horrible! I am sad because I wanted to enjoy this movie so bad being that its a gay love story shot in Miami. but it was truly terrible.",2
"  I know why it is relevant, I know why it is praised, and I know it is not my kinda movie.",1
  heart breaking and moving,5
  Sorry as usual top critic movie not worth the viewing time.,1
"  Moonlight beautifully encapsulates life's hardships with its well profound protagonist. Barry Jenkins direction is gorgeous to say the least, and the films story can be emotionally overwhelming at one point, and beautifully touching in the next. Moonlight is a work of cinematic splendor that will stick with viewers years to come.",5
"  Very nice directed, but not an influential film.",1
"  Beautiful story, excellent cinematography. Perfect from the beginning to the end. No wonder it won best movie of the year.",5
  This was a beautiful and heart-wrenching film.,5
"  I watched this movie expecting a deep engaging story but ended up with questions never answered, no connection with the characters and a strong feeling of How the hell was this movie even mentioned in the Oscars.",0
  Why didn't they finish the movie?,2
"  Humanizes drug dealers, through their personal realization of their sexual orientation, to a level that seems to excuse their menacing behavior. There is a disregard for how the generational cycle of poverty and violence is supported by the main character's decisions.",1
"  Interesting characters, just not my style. No story arcs.",2
"  Silence as a tool, emotions as a guide. A masterpiece.",5
"  Liked it, didn't love it. The performances, however, were outstanding. Especially the actors who portrayed Chiron...they were fantastic.",4
"  This isn't a movie, it's a series of scenes that will make you feel feelings, but lack any cohesiveness. I really didn't think there was anything memorable about it. A lot of people say they loved this movie, but nobody is ever going to watch it twice",0
  great lessons are taught in this movie great movie,5
"  Moonlight understands the power in the unspoken. There is so much beauty and meaning packed into the subdued moments, the patient close-ups. There are no twists here, no shocking moments, but the profound humanity in Moonlight makes it truly memorable",4
"  A good film. Just not 'Best Picture' good. All the three actors portraying Chiron were amazing. Overall, I liked all the child & adult actors. According to me, there were some other nominees like 'Arrival' who were more deserving for the award.",4
  Amazing story telling on a topic that many still would find it hard to acknowledge. But the brave cast & crew make it really easy to take it in. It's slow & dark but extremely powerful. But is it the best film of the year? Not convinced enough. Nonetheless it is a cinema defining movie.,4
  One of the most powerful coming of age movies. A worthy Oscar winner.,4
"  Beyobd unbelievable that this could win Best Picture, as it probably the worst filmI have ever seen! If you want to see the Worst Picture of the year, this is the film for you!",0
  Brave and inspired original story... though not as flawless as I was led to believe given the accolades.,4
  I didn't care for this movie got bored half but truly 30 mins in,1
"  An intricate and fundamentally important piece of storytelling. The movie is raw, real edgy cinematic work and some stellar acting performances. This is a powerful plot with a beautiful but real back setting. Brilliant movie.",4
  Amazing movie of quiet moments that scream truth. Great acting and a visionary director.,5
  A slow-burner but v beautiful.,5
"  Incredible film. Not seen a film like this in a long, long time.",5
"  I don't understand how this won Best Picture. Hidden Figures was better, and La La Land should have been awarded Best Picture.",0
"  Moonlight is a great movie and One of the best movies I've seen all year, it's got great performances, great acting, a fantastic Scrip and story, and a score that is almost haunting and beautiful, moonlight is a perfectly executed character study of a young man discovering is homosexuality and himself in a way, there's so many great things about it, all the actors involved in this movie we're very invested in what role they were playing and what characters they were playing and own it, all the actors in the movie give the best performances I've seen all year, even the three actors who played Shyrone the main character in this movie do a fantastic job, mostly the film is really strung together by all the fantastic performances, if you're an aspiring writer then watch this movie and take notes, cause that's how you wright great characters, the only problem I have with the movie is the dream sequences in the movie but they weren't bad at all it's just an artistic decision I didn't agree with, it isn't an epic film that changed my life in any way, but for what it is, it's very very well done, it's the best character study that we have seen in years, it's basically personal preference for me giving it a 10/10, for me personally, it's a 9/10",4
"  Just saw Moonlight yesterday. Great acting, but have no idea how it won Best Picture over fantastic movies like Hidden Figures, Lion and Hacksaw Ridge.",2
  A combination of brutal & beautiful.,4
"  the plight of a gay boy becoming a man in one of the roughest places in Miami made for a phenomenal movie. The direction they decided to take the movie was the perfect artistic choice; one that I thought they weren't going to take, but I was pleasantly surprised with part 3 goin the direction it did.",5
"  Let's first admit that there is a major drift in the contemporary film industry between what good filmmaking is and what content might be, the global scene is confused as to what really makes a good movie, and momentary social, cultural and political influences make this confusion far worse, and it's because of this that a movie like Moonlight ever received any recognition in the first place.Technically, the film's reality is that it's completely amateurish, if I didn't know better I'd have thought it was a film school project at best, a screenplay that wants to say things but doesn't, a director who shoots whatever is available and moves to the next shot, and a horrible editing job that would be so bad even for a first draft it makes you lose any sense of pacing or story.Basically it's a movie with a very specific audience that might appreciate it, and unfortunately, the people working on the Academy Awards are part of that demographic, but the movie will always fail to be universal, not because of its setting or its character, people loved City of God and it was celebrated worldwide, while Moonlight will never be because of all of its mediocre elements that hinder it from being relatable, unless you're an American justice warrior who wants to capture the bold lines of a story about a poor gay black kid growing up as a headline with total disregard to what the movie really is.In 20 years, we'll look back and wonder how was it even possible for this mediocre piece to get half the recognition it received, because the momentary circumstances that lead to its acceptance would have changed, and that is not what cinema is about, cinema is meant to be universal and eternal, even if humanity as we know it has completely changed.",2
  The worst movie I've ever seen! what the hell was this ? and I don't know what the critics saw in this this... stupid movie!,0
  This movie doesn't deserve that high rating,1
"  Brilliant showing of the insecurities that stick with you throughout life, that everyone can relate to in one way or another, and how they can shape you.",5
"  I don't even know what to say! I guess I expected a whole lot more from this three part drama and it just left me wondering about a lot of things that were left unexplained throughout the film. Personally, I did not like it at all.",1
"  I watched this because of the Oscars. Was it about growing up gay? Was it about drugs? Was it about bullying, dysfunctional home life? It left more questions.......not a fan.",2
"  Many thought that La La Land was the huge favorite to win this year's Best Picture at the 89th Academy Awards. While not the front-runner, there were a few (including me) that thought Moonlight had a very high chance at stealing that award and those predictions came to fruition recently. While many see the film as the academy's answer to the ""#OscarsSoWhite"" backlash from last year, that was not the reason this film was praised by the masses. The film's original story of a child dealing with identity issues complimented the amazing performance by the cast. Combine that with Barry Jenkins' great eye for imagery and thus you have one of the best films of the year.",4
  A different story about a kid who happens to be gay and his struggle through life. It's a different movie that some may not like but it's worth a shot and it's good to try something new and original.,4
"  This film is close to perfet. We are immersed in a heartbreaking journey of the main character as he tries to face his true identity while dealing with his culture, mother and social pressures. The acting and cinematography are top notch. It's a story that needs to be told, and it is told in the least preachy way possible. It uses silence, at times, to create the most powerful emotions.",5
"  One of the best movies I have ever seen. the acting is phenomenal, the cinematography is amazing, and the story is beautiful. Some may say it is too slow, but I loved it. I would definitely recommend to anybody.",5
  Boring. La La Land should have won.,1
"  Great movie, even greater cinematography! Just wanted a better third act :/",4
"  Not a fan. I had high expectations for this movie because it won an Oscar, but the movie was so choppy. It didn't prove to be the artsy cinematic artistic type that I am a fan of. Would not watch it again. Sadly disappointed",1
"  This movie is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Everything in this movie is perfect. The acting is perfect, the writing is perfect, the camera work...is breathtaking. I can't find one real flaw in this entire film.",5
"  Highly overrated movie, I was never able to connect with the character. It leaves you hanging in the middle, weird camera angles shots for the sake of being different. What a pointless movie",1
"  What a wonderful movie. Very moving, sad but so many good parts. I loved it!",0
  Amazing Cinematography. Good acting. Boring,2
"  After seeing this film, comparing Moonlight to Boyhood feels a little bit shallow. While Boyhood uses age as a true set-piece, Moonlight uses age to tell a story about acceptance and belonging. For a movie that is based in Florida, it's hard for people to come into this movie not expecting a story about growing up in harsh environment. While the film does this fairly well, that is most definitely not it's focus. The film can naturally speak to anyone who has ever experienced a feeling that only resides with time and understanding of one's self.",5
"  This was the picture of a lifetime! The cinematography, the story, the characters, everything was well worth watching. The fact that this a film with LGBTQ themes and with an all-colored cast are only a few reasons of many on why this was worth the Best Picture win.",5
"  It was long and confusing, interesting story that it was based on a true story, also sad",2
  In no way did this deserve the Oscar for best picture or supporting actor! Very well made and excellent score but not Oscar worthy,4
  Excellent. Must see. Well Deserving of all the praise.,4
  Don't waste your time,0
  Tough to agree with the academy on Moonlight. It seemed like a type of movie that was nominated because it touched on a sensitive subject in today's world. Acting was the one aspect of the movie I enjoyed but that's not enough to win best picture.,2
"  Construit sur trois actes parfaitement homogènes, ce qui est déjà en soi une énorme réussite, Moonlight est une remarquable étude de personnage, qui parvient à mêler énormément de thèmes sans pour autant que l'un cannibalise les autres. Les 3 acteurs qui jouent le rôle de Chiron parviennent à créer un personnage cohérent sans pour autant se ressembler vraiment, tandis que Janelle Monae et Mahershala Ali sont absolument parfaits. Moonlight est un film remarquablement mis en scène, tout en retenue et en douceur, sans jamais tomber dans le misérabilisme. Moonlight est un très grand film.",5
  Boring boring boring.....,0
"  First two parts were absolutely amazing but the last part did slow down a bit, but still incredible.",4
  It's a good movie but not for everyone. The acting was brilliant and for this kind of story I don't think there would be a better way to approach it. For me though it just isn't my cup of tea. It gets 4 stars from me because it really is a well done film.,4
"  When people ask me, ""What was your favorite movie of the year?"" I don't say Moonlight. When people ask me ""What was the best film of the year?"" I say Moonlight. This is a dark, gritty story that felt like it wasn't being told because anyone decided to tell it, but more like fate had been leading Barry Jenkins and company towards this their whole lives. The obvious comparison would be Boyhood, and it feels that grand in scope, but more timely. If you had told me that they filmed all of the iterations of the main character, Chiron, over a twenty year span with the same actor, I would have believed you. However, if there is one thing I will remember from Moonlight down the line (because it is a little heavy for a regular spot in the rotation), it will be Mahershala Ali. I loved Dev Patel's performance in Lion, and in many ways it was more athletic, but I would have turned off the Academy Awards after the first card had Ali not won. The scene at the dinner table could have been his only scene in the movie, and he would have earned that Oscar. That is all. 9.2/10",4
  The acting and visual storytelling are what drives this movie. I thought it was very well done and intriguing throughout.,4
  huge Movie! I love it,5
"  This movie is remarkable. The characters are raw, the scenes intense, all while drawing the audience back into adolescence and the question of one's identity.",5
  How in the HELL did this win an Oscar???,0
  Not my kind of movie. Didn't care for.,1
  Powerful film with some great acting and cinematography but not a film for me to watch.,2
  This movie made me uncomfortable and I do not understand how it won an academy award.,1
"  Cheesy reunion film. Pushes black, male sexuality without adult males kissing. I won't remember this film.",1
"  Great director and cinematography, Character were well rounded with amazing performances by Naomi Harris and Ashton Sanders. BUT.... I can not be the only one that was BORED BORED BORED. I personally need a bit more plot to all these wonderful characters and apart from a few scenes this movie and the praise its getting is lost on me! I guess the point of some scenes is to build suspense but does it all amount to anything really in the end or have you just watched someone driving, eating, walking about for an hour of screen time. Sorry, not for me.",2
"  a film about a young man struggling to find himself..whether its dealing with his drug addict mother or his own sexuality as well as bullying ..The film is told in 3 different chapters..Little, Chiron and Black. Great acting and beautifully filmed",4

  horrible! if it was a woman and a man movie... no one would see it,0
"  ""Was there ONE white actor in this movie?!"" was the first thing I heard as I left the theater after watching Moonlight, just a few hours ago. I also heard remarks such as ""I'm not a homophobe, but,"" and ""How could this piece of trash lose to La La Land."" I was amused when I found out that those sentences came from the very same people that kept moving uncomfortably in their chairs, and talking out loud, and turning on their cell phones whenever the theme of homosexuality came up on the screen-which is pretty much all through the movie. A hell of a traumatizing experience, one might add. It wasn't. The movie is so powerful and captivating, and it carries such innocent sublimity that, in the end, the only thing that really annoyed me about my company was how come they couldn't appreciate such an honest, beautiful picture as that. Because Moonlight is more than necessary: it's beautiful.",5
"  Uncomfortable, unnerving, inquisitive. Particularly interesting in the way the story was told. Casting was pretty remarkable in that they were able to seamlessly tell the story while it always felt like the same person. Let's the audience find the answers on their own while leaving subtle enough clues that the payoff is still worth while. Felt like a lot of subject matter shoehorned in all at once.",4
  It's a subtle indie film to it. Good tale from the hood. But not really best picture quality. It's only a peace offering of the Academy due to the issue of them 'being so white' last year.,2
  This is a horrible movie. I would rather watch moss grow.,0
"  Boring, no purpose, not thought provoking, why",2
"  What a wast of film and 2 hours of my life. The only reason this moviewon an Oscar was because of the subjects and subject matter and theneed to ""diversify"", not because it's a good movie.",0
"  Moonlight is the story of Chiron and his harsh life in Miami where he's trying to find both himself and a way to survive. The film follows Chiron through three phases of his life, all of which are pivotal in shaping the man that he becomes. I've heard from others that Manchester By the Sea has a very depressing feel to it. Well, Moonlight is no stranger to the darker side either. It suffocates you with sadness. You want it to stop but at the same time you know it's necessary.I question some of the stylistic choices at times, my only gripe in addition to the fact that there are no cheer-worthy high points to look forward to. The film jumps around a bit, which would be fine if I didn't have to already contemplate the things I just saw. At times it felt like I had just eaten a healthy plate of food then went for a run directly after. For its flaws, however, Moonlight is highly original. It does more than offer a fresh perspective on a story that's already been done. Rather it takes you inside a story you've never heard of or seen before. How does one survive in Chiron's living conditions? Furthermore, how does one survive in Chiron's living conditions AND struggle with sexuality at the same time? These are just one of many questions this film challenges you to try and answer.The film excels in a number of things, evoking emotion being one of the leaders. You would be hard pressed for your heart not to break as you watch Chiron grow in all three phases of his life. You want this kid to get a win so bad, but life continues to hand him a raw deal. I loved the consistency that all three characters used to bring this character to life. As he gradually developed into a man, he was still the same lost kid at his core. Awkward. Shy. Man of little words. One can't help but wonder how differently his life would have been had he grown up in the same environment the characters from La La Land did.The real world isn't a fairytale and Moonlight does an excellent job of capturing this truth. It's a film that will stick with you long after you have watched it. I give it an 84.",4
"  Plot was too predictable and boring. The dialogues, when there were any, were below average with nothing memorable or to give food for though. All in all a waste of time in my opinion.",1
  Didn't like at all....that is 6 ladies opinion.,1
"  Slow moving, average at best, coming of age story, stealing years of tropes and stereotypes to make it 'untouchable' by audiences. African American gay man, beaten up by bullies, growing up in the hood, his Mom is crack addicted... I didn't hate this movie, but it wasn't the explosion of originality and artsy enchantment that, especially the Academy Awards, everyone oversold and over hyped.",2
"  This movie is HORRIBLE. Boring, pointless, full of stereotypes and PC baloney. His mother is a prostitute and drug addict. Really?? Wow that's original. We walked out of a movie for the first time since District 9.",1
  excellent story...this could be anybody in modern day america..,4
"  Sad, but a great movie",4
  Absolutely one of the worst movies ever. There is no plot. The episodes from the main character's life seem unconnected. Interesting characters disappear with no explanation.,0
"  If you're a fan of artistry in the filmmaking industry, this is the film for you. Barry Jenkins, a fairly new director to the big screen, delivers an outstanding adaptation of a story about adversity in more than one aspect of life. I like to keep these short and sweet, so please give it a try if you are craving incredible cinematography, a moving score, and powerful acting from a refreshingly unknown cast.",5
  Horrible Movie - don't waste your time !,0
"  Beautiful movie - and a day later, I'm can't stop thinking about it and and all the subtle themes that came up in the movie. A highly deserved best picture win!",5
"  Is this what you'd call ""mumblecore""?",4
  Realistic... Brutal... Visceral,5
  Contrived to make politically correct points,1
"  Masterpiece, deserved every award it got.",5
"  Didnt like this movie, to many things not explained...... Dont see the reason for all the hype...... Seems like its just pushin the agenda......",1
"  Beautiful film that gets better the more you reflect on Chiron's life and personalize his journey. There are moments and people in our lives that, however fleeting there existences may be, take us on paths that we did not anticipate, sometimes taking further and sometimes closer to whom we are at our cores. This journey to self-knowledge, inner peace and love is not to be missed.",5
  Not worthy of the Oscar for best picture,2
"  you have to be kidding me! WTF is wrong with people.. really this is junk and the critics need to really find new jobs. This garbage won an award. We are truly doomed as a society. Consider the fact it lasted less than a few weeks in the theaters.. you have hacksaw ridge a classic that was entertaining and well written, but of course... not a mention. What a joke.",0
"  A delicate look at life, specifically a side of life that many take for granted, as well as a technical marvel in its own right: it's no coincidence that every key scene is bathed in blue in some way. This is truly something special.",5
  This was a raw ugly movie but artfully put together. You feel everything in this movie and it was beautifully executed,5
  Amazing group of actors.,4
"  Worst,....movie,....ever,...........boring,....Oscar for WORST picture of the year. This movie was chosen as a token just to appease leftist communities and nothing more. The academy should be ashamed.",0
  Moonlight is a powerful drama of self discovery with great performances and a fantastic script. This provides a well deserve academy award for best picture,5
  Moonlight is an amazing movie that broadcast the struggles of many surreal childhood issues in this world. It's brilliantly acted as well as it is directed. The movie manages to keep you interested and intrigued throughout the entire film while keeping s slow pace and drawing everyone watching inside of Chirons life. Not only was the cast perfect but the characters are full of depth and all add something to the story making them all useful.,5
"  Sensitive, powerful, exceptionally well done and in a word BEAUTIFUL",5
"  Boring beyond belief. At best Moonlight is an Indie Art House movie. 2017 continues to operate under a parallel universe. The critic herd that gave such glorious reviews staggers me. Did they even watch it? Moonlight won Academy Awards for Best Picture & Best Adapted Screenplay and nominations for Best Director & Best Cinematography. Are you kidding me? I thought there was some standard to be in the same class as Casablanca, On The Waterfront or Lawrence of Arabia. Moonlight does not even hold a candle to another nominee like Hidden Figures. Andy Warhol was before his time he could have won Best Picture for Empire with this Academy. Can we not at least operate under the premise that a Best Picture winner has to have some consistent entertainment value? Alfred Hitchcock once said that, ""Drama is life with the dull bits cut out"", which would have made Moonlight a very, very short film.",0
"  This won BEST PICTURE??? Faye Dunaway got it right the first time, La La Land IS the Oscar winner for ""BEST PICTURE""!!!",2
  Snail slow don't get academy award???,1
"  Not a lot to say, as not a lot happened. I'm astounded this won Best Picture. There is really not much to it. Good acting but where's the substance? I hated it",0
  Don't think this was worthy of the oscar,0
  I'm sure it's a great movie but Lala Land should've won.,4
"  Moonlight excels at delivering a character study on this one human's life and his journey in three parts, his childhood, his teenager stage and his adulthood. We see his life unfold in trying to find himself in a world where he struggles to fit in. Moonlight does everything right in giving us a powerful story of the inability to transcend human existence just because they are unaccepted. The film express this one character in a way that's gut wrenching and super dark. With excellent directing, a perfect score, and surprising acting performances throughout, Moonlight makes you feel connected, and it makes you understand what it means to be human, and the adversities we face that mold our way to destruction.",5
"  will (white) people realise how heartbreaking this is.. A totally astonishing film, don't miss it",5
  ZERO RATING! WASTE OF TIME. GOOD ACTING. HORRIBLE STORY. MY 6 YEAR OLD CAN WRITE A BETTER STORY.,0
"  ""Moonlight"" is one the best movies about identity in recent memory! Its story fits perfectly in violent environments that had shape several young boys and girls, transforming them into the human beings they are today, without making them forgetting where they came from. Barry Jekins is approved to continue making masterpieces like this,reserving a place for himself as one of the best directors of his generation!",5
"  Arguably one of the bravest films of the year, Moonlight utilises subdued performances from a stellar (yet not particularly well-known) cast about the three stages of growing up as a gay, black boy in a poor family on the outskirts of Miami, with a drug-addict mother. If that doesn't have Oscar written all over it, I don't know what does. The only major issue here being the pacing in some areas- but otherwise, a delight.Verdict: A-",4
"  There's a good reason why this movie is ""too rarely seen in cinema"". It's terrible, displaying life on the outer edge in it's darkest forms, devoid of all hope and charity. quite unlike real life for most people. Likely another effort on the part of some fringe group to shove some realism down our throats, the more uncomfortable the better? Very disappointing.",0
"  We don't explore the world in this movie, we focus on a character one that thinks he is flawed, he is scared, and above all trying to find himself. That true intent to see what someone's life is, was, and will be is a thing of beauty in this near perfect movie. All parts are spot on with good direction, I must say my favorite and the highlight of this film is the great score.",5
  Very well done film. Must see.,5
"  I thought the first and second acts were interesting, but the last act was awful. I couldn't even finish it. I guess that's the unpopular opinion considering all the awards it's won and the general rating, but it just wasn't for me.",0
"  I, thoroughly, enjoyed the movie... but, I was left wanting more... I feel that the story didn't give me sufficient closure.",4
"  It's not one of those action packed movies that I like, but one of those movie that the title don't catch your eye but it got awards in the oscars so I decided to check it out and it actually came out pretty interesting to see, ending sucked though.",2
"  The film assembles its character portrait of woe very well and very efficiently, with Jenkins and his cinematographer James Laxton showing a love for moving their camera through busy scenes in a single take. Yet Chiron's journey becomes slowly overwhelmed by the film's swelling sense of self-importance. We're meant to read great profundity into every pregnant pause and depressing turn, as though the issues of troubled black urban youths are being raised on film for the first time. It becomes very tedious very quickly. And, frankly, ""Moonlight"" simply runs out of puff, with too little in the film's final chapter to drive it home to a closure that is dramatically satisfying. While ""La La Land"" isn't the pinnacle of originality, obviously, ""Moonlight"" felt unoriginal and at times pretentious. Not the Best Picture.",2
  Excellent film. You will find yourself rooting for Chiron to find happiness.,5
"  A life in three acts. The first chronicling a bullied child who is mentored by a charismatic drug dealer. The second act details his struggles with bullies and emerging sexuality. Followed by the final act which is a glimpse of him as a young man. Fantastic performances, beautiful cinematography, and well-written dialogue. This is as good as it gets.",5
  Moonlight shines on its own with its unique story-telling.,4
  Really good! I wish it didn't feel like it cut off at the end. And grown Chiron didn't look like teen or child Chiron.,4
  Hacía años que no me aburría tanto una ganadora del Oscar. Esperaba mucho más de esta película y de verdad que me decepcionó.,1
"  Seriously, I remember now why I don't trust movies that ""experts"" give awards to. This movie has no climax, a terrible ending. Yes, the actors that play the main character are great - but the story is poorly developed. Some characters you never hear of again.... it's just not good. A waste of time.",1
"  Damn fine film. Excellent character study.And very much like ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" all three leads playing Moonlight's protagonist Chiron, are all note-perfect and compelling.Not at all what you might be expecting. Very little violence. No bloodshed (unless a scratch counts.) No explicit sex (save for a few brief intimate moments, one being a dream sequence.) Just a mesmerizing glide through a young introverted man's life, dealing with a drug-using Mom at home and gay-bashing adolescents being cruel for the easy pickings of it.A few questions left unanswered don't detract from the sheer pleasure of watching this hypnotic drama. Extremely well-crafted and ends on a note of reconciliation and no unnecessary ""feel-good"" contrivances. A sleeper hit and deservedly so.",4
  Horrible movie. Should have walked out.,0
"  Really? No, REALLY?! I walked out. It was slow, ridiculously shallow character building, no depth because there was hardly any talking. It was just trying way too hard. Us white folk, we fall for this crap. Okay with the realism - I get it. Live is hard and sucks for many, maybe most - but this movie rubs it in your face. I think being that they voted this the best picture of the year, with all those other pictures which were so much, much better, I think Hollywood has lost it. Boring! My WORST movie of the year.",1
"  If you think art should challenge us then maybe you'll embrace Barry Jenkins' nearly perfectly crafted film, Moonlight. This film is quite the accomplishment , not just for its unique narrative development , rather for its realistic qualities from its characters, themes, and environment that despite being labeled as a ""gay, coming of age story"" are quite universal that all empathetic individuals can get identify with. A thought provoking tale about the human condition that's a must-see! The cinematography is also out-of-sight",5
  I think sometimes reviews on Flixster not real. There were a few good parts in the movie but generally speaking it was very slow and boring.,0
"  One of the WORSE movies we've ever seen!! Its boring, depressing and badly made. I thought it would develop into something interesting but it was just a sad and poorly done movie. The subject, which was interesting and had potential was dragged out and boring. It was in fact so horrible that we had to get up and leave midmovie. And not just us!",0
  no thank you I don't want to waste my money on this gutter trash movie.,0
  Absolutely TERRIBLE!!!,0
"  Perfectly acted. Perfectly direction, shot, written, everything. It was legit a perfect movie. It deserved every oscar ever. Great concept, Great execution. Flawless.",5
  Good Movie but I dont think Best Picture,4
  Didn't really like it.,2
"  Telling a story, may be a typical one, how an African American grew up. Not that Entertaining. Best Picture ? Not on my list.",1
  This movie was terrible. I was really disappointed. What a huge waste of time.,0
  See this asap. Great movie,4
  Mixed feelings about this one....a good story tho. I didn't like the ending...they leave you hanging....no pun intended.,4
"  I just saw moonlight. Hollywood has lost its collective mind. This is not the worst movie to win the Oscar in 30 years, it is the worst movie nominated in the last 30 years. It has no redeeming value as entertainment, art or any other category.",0
"  Disappointing! I made the mistake of assuming Best Picture award meant it would be worth seeing. There's some good acting, but the storyline and script are awful. Be forewarned, this is NOT just a movie about a young boy struggling with his identity.",1
"  Mahershala's role is important, if brief, and set's a quietly poignant tone in the first act. All three incarnations of our protagonist are well executed and consistent. And the message of this film is a lot more powerful than the mere narrative of Chiron's life.",4
  Powerful performances and clever camera work make this a very worthy winner of 'Best Picture' which belies it's small budget. Naomie Harris is the real stand out performance.,4
"  Bravo Barry Jenkins , Holland, Harris & Ali...A truly an Oscar performance movie..You guys well deserve more oscars for the team performance..I saw it 3 times and I cannot get enough...words are not enough..A MUST SEE...TRULY A MUST SEE....BRAVO",5
"  A beautiful piece of independent cinematographic art Moonlight is touching, though-provoking and extraordinary movie. A magnificent blend of acting, directing and camera-work, this is an intimate and personal story which works as a strikingly realistic essay on social, racial and sexual tensions in the post-modern US society. The story of young Afro-American Chiron and his struggle to find his place in society, to express and to accept his sexuality is told in three different stages of his life. Tensed and yet gentle, the story is disturbingly painful as it delves into the themes of race, sexuality and isolation. Still, every minute of Barry Jenkins' story is told in a delicate, beautifully crafted manner which also allow the cast to shine in their outstanding performances. Naomi Harris, Ashton Sanders (teen Chiron), Trevante Rhodes (adult Chiron) and of course Maherashala Ali stun with their on-screen presences. None of them truly shines on his own, but together as a team, with their restrained, but deeply emotional performances, they succeeds to provide the final element to Barry Jenkins' flawless movie: the acting. Acting as human beings, acting as people who are part of this story and not only people getting into specific characters. Speaking Maherashala Ali, especially after his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, it should be noted the impact which he has on the movie. Even with his limited participation, his embodiment of a drug dealer with a human dignity and love for other human beings is one of the most striking things you will see in a movie. Touching, loving and caring, he is among the most unorthodox drug dealers you would ever see on the screen, while remaining absolutely convincing and realistic as a character.In conclusion, Moonlight is a most delightful and unforgettable example of independent quality film-making. Touching, gut-wrenching and unforgettably intimate, this is a magnificent poem-turned-into-movie about American reality, sexuality and social tension. A most deserved Oscar Best Movie winner, this is a must see modern classic.",5
"  For all the great things Moonlight did it was overshadowed by its glaring issues as a full-length feature film.Moonlight did some really great things that will be looked back on and even studied by up and coming film students. The cinematography of Moonlight was absolutely astounding and really mirrored the character study and moods that the film portrayed. The direction of photography was also very gripping where it counted. The best thing about Moonlight is the acting, Alex Hibbert as Little Chiron was the most moving part of this film followed by Mahershala Ali as Juan the drug dealer. Both these roles were poignant and so deep that as I watched Moonlight, in the beginning, I was sure this was the best picture of 2016. Then the story played out and the character arcs fell to the sides and Moonlight truly disappointed me.Here is my overall impression as the credits rolled, I was bored and unfulfilled. Moonlight was an interesting film as all character studies are interesting, but I felt disconnected from it. Characters I cared about were not fully fleshed out or just disappeared from the story altogether and without explanation. It's funny that this movie moves from childhood to life as a teenager to young adulthood but the story itself never fills this flow. It's disjointed and leaves the audience behind as it swiftly moves from plot point to plot point. In places where Moonlight could have soared and paid off it's very emotional story it instead switches gears and falls flat. I was so interested in the relationship Chiron had with Juan and Theresa as pseudo-parents and it never pays off or even concludes to move us forward. Instead, it brings us to a climax with Chiron's actual mother and Juan and even this scene is desperately unfulfilling.After I saw the movie I found out it was originally a fifteen-page short story and it makes total sense that the adaptation had problems. Moonlight would have been a better short film or maybe even a pseudo-documentary. It definitely wasn't the best film of 2016 but neither was La La Land in my opinion.",2
  Like a Miami ghetto Brokeback Mountian,4
"  With a feeling of unseen significance, Moonlight's beautiful presentation forms a brilliant experience.",4
  I don't understand how this won Best Picture. It's really slow and boring. You don't really care about the characters. Pretty hard to ever rewatch again.,2
  There are moments of sorrow and brilliant acting but this movies lacks any true sense of excitementDisappointment far outweighs any childhood fears created or even directedMy advice would be to turn it off before it ends with little or no sense of captivation.,1
"  I don't understand how this was even nominated for an Oscar. Melding speech challenged child, poverty, bullying, drugs, gay and gangster together into one character is not in itself interesting. Yes, we feel sorry for children whose potential is lost due to the world being a hard place. The Academy is hopelessly self absorbed if they think voting for this movie will help. It is also extremely slow.",2
  just a good movie. it moved me emotionally,5
"  An incredibly tender, nuanced and beautiful film.",5
"  When I first saw the preview of this movie, I said ""not interested;"" however I was sucked in by the number of Oscar nominations & wins the movie received, so I decided to see what the hype was about...I should have stuck with my original thought. I was so bored with the storyline that I could only stand to waist 45 minutes of my life on this movie. In this 45 minutes, there was minimal dialogue, nothing but sadness, horrible music, & mediocre performances. Mind you, I did not make it past 45 minutes so the storyline could have improved; but, I have already lost time in my life that I could not regain so I decided to cut my losses and end the misery. #notallitwascrackedup2b",0
  Beautifully shot. Amazing acting. Emotional story. Great pacing. All round an amazing movie.,4
"  This movie is for LGBT community. If you re heterosexual this movie will feel very strange watching with your husband. Mostly male gay film, NOT gay bashing in any fashion, I have many gay friends. This movie made me totally uncomfortable as a straight person watching the movie with my husband. seriously, if your watching this with your gay bio, do you its wonderful. other than that if you rent this as a date night...you will feel like damn is he thinking of having sex with a man while were together? mixed reviews 50/50??????",0
"  Enlightening, human. Message is current and needs to be shown. Excellent cinematography.",5
  Beautifully shot with excellent performances all around. The ending will leave you wanting more but not in a good way.,4
  not that good. kinda boring,2
  Effictive film portrait of a young boy struggling to understand his own sexuality and almost never fully accepting his own inner identity. Well played characters in every role.,4
  Unreal storytelling. Because it's so real you will weep. 100% worth the hype and accolades.,5
  Don't really know what to say and why it won the Oscar. The movie was hard to finish but the best part was I could finish it,1
  Not only is it story telling at its finest but it's cinematic art. Also love how low budget it is. Inspiring performance by Maherahala Ali. It's a must watch.,4
"  If you're looking for a painfully boring experience with not one drop of joy or inspiration about anything memorable to take away - this one's for you. I would daresay 5 or 10 years after it won the Oscar for best picture, not many will want to see it (or remember it). To add salt into the wound, there was one last thing that really wanted to make me slap the director: Speaking as a food industry pro, I guess it was only a fitting piece of ridiculousness was when the cook in the diner was also (wait for it).... the waiter! And the cashier! I have my theories on how & why this movie got made (and won any awards at all).",1
"  Two stars only for techniques (Thank god for the techniques or else it would have been negative stars). The movie is beautifully crafted. The directing, detailing and actings are almost perfect. However, the whole story is incredibly draggy, and the bullying scenes just make me wanna roll my eyes. Seriously, the bullying, homosexual experience in this movie have only been put on screens 100 times before. I can see why it won awards, but by no means it's as great as people say. What is the message of this movie? And how is that different from those other 10000 indie movies out there? Yet people say La La Land is overrated and empty. The world is funny I guess.",2
  Very poignant... artfully crafted,5
"  2016's Best Picture Winner is a semi-autobiographical film that focuses on a life growing up in the most estranged places in America. A unique and investing drama that may not use real acting talents half the time though the film will explore it's setting and characters to find it's own sense of remarkable beauty, brilliantly brought to life by the directing and cinematography. When it comes to peeling back the layers of the film, Moonlight isn't all too confronting though when the pace drags and meanders it's a fascinating watch something I kinda wish I saw earlier before it's odd Best Picture Winning at the Academy Awards.",5
  Beautifully understated. A masterpiece.,4
"  Unbelievably bad film, definitely the most overrated ever.Implausible and undeveloped characters (crack dealer with a heart!?) ridiculous story line (crack dealer turns up at home with a young boy and his wife says 'ok' !?) Utter tosh, cliched rubbish design to get the PC vote for awards.",0
  This was the most boring movie I have ever seen! The directing was poor- verbal exchanges too slow- and didn't make sense! Everyone leaving the theater said the same thing. Warren Beaty's academy slip makes more sense.,1
  Not as great as people say,0
"  This movie is so sad, the loneliness of the main character is so poignant, almost unbearable...Great performances.",4
  Amazing! Beautiful and complex.,4
"  Awesome, technically sophisticated movie, that actually tries hard, to give credit to the original manga / anime sources. The futuristic world is a joy to look at. If you like to visit futuristic, slightly run-down urban worlds, like we've seen in ""Blade Runner"" or ""The Fifth Element"" with ""Matrix""-like action pieces, this movie delivers! Unfortunately, there has been a campaign, with the intent to smear the movie's reputation by accusing it of ""whitewashing"", because the lead role was not given to an actor of Asian descent, but to Scarlett Johansson, who does a remarkable job of basically playing a cyborg. The subtle way she's moving, turning and shifting her weight, to appear more robot-like is great acting. But she's white and that's enough for a small, but very vocal minority, to ""hate"" on this magnificent piece of Sci-Fi action movie, which is kinda sad.If you take the time to watch the extra footage, you will notice, how much the film makers actually tried to honour the source material, but the ""whitewashing""-screamers don't care, they drank the ""more diversity"" (meaning: less whites!) Kool-Aid and decided, that this film has to be ""bad"" because of Hollywood's very relatable decision, to cast the movie's leading role with a well known, established actress, that is supposed to get as many people into the cinemas as possible, instead of some Asian no-name, what's the surprise?! That's just, how Hollywood works. And IS the main character really that much different from it's manga original?! Johansson plays a character, called ""Major"", who (SPOILER!!!) later finds out, that she's actually an Asian(!) girl, named Motoko Kusanagi, that has been recruited without her knowledge and been given a new body / shell. The whole story plays in a world, where everybody can swap and enhance their bodies with all sorts of technical and biomechanical gimmicks. So an Asian character in an artificial white body is enough for many people to condemn and shun this beautiful film?! I'm far from being an expert for the original GITS manga / anime, I've seen the anime years ago and didn't like it much, but I'm not an anime fan at all. But from what I recall, the main character was a girl called ""Motoko Kusanagi"", who inhibits an artificial body, that looks pretty westernized to my eyes. But it's an artificial body anyway, she could appear as a person of colour or even as a man! So, where's the difference?! I'm sure, this whole ""whitewashing"" smear campaign has gotten way out of proportion, after having been completely unjustified, in the first place.Another point of critique was, that the movie doesn't concentrate enough on the philosophical themes of GITS and doesn't dive deep enough into it. Again, I'm not an expert for the original, but those themes are in the movie, a lot of it, actually. Major is constantly searching for her humanity and there is some philosophical dialogue throughout the movie, but this is, first and foremost, a fast-paced action movie, not a full blown philosophical excourse in what makes us human. If you like those sort of themes, you might be better off by purchasing the mangas. I personally think, this movie has just the right amount of philosophical themes to think about afterwards, without spoiling the formidable action. I wouldn't want to sit through two hours of heavy philosophical discussion, I love crazy action and shootouts and the film delivers! If you like Sci-Fi and masterfully executed action in a Blade Runner-like urban setting, you should give this film a chance, it is worth it and a great, but very, very underrated piece of Sci-Fi action cinema.",5
"  All in all, the film passes the feeling of being incomplete due to shallow plot and the empty characters, the intention to create goals for the main character does not work. The rich scenery and possibilities of the cyberpunk world is sadly harnessed.",2
  I think they were in a desperate need to put Johansson in a skin suit.,1
  Visually stunning and an amazing plot. I finally got around to seeing this movie after avoiding it for over a year. I wanted to avoid it after I had heard about how bad the movie was and how this movie cast a white actor in as an Asian for the main role. I have to say that the casting is not bad and it is understandable to have cast Scarlett Johansson since The Major is full cyborg and could really look like anything. I was surprised to see that Togusa was not played by a white actor since he and Batou always seemed like the most American characters. I also wanted to see the chief's beard but that is not important. When the credits started and the intro to the 1995 movie started to play I actually smiled to myself which is rare. Batou's eyes are too small.,4
"  Only one star for references to the real ghost in the shell. But what is this movie? It is not Ghost in the shell. But only a ghost in the shell skin put on another product. They did same thing to the avengers in 1998 with fake steed and Ms peel. And I don't speak about impossible mission. This movie don't merit to be called ""ghost in the shell""and it insults its model.",1
"  Ghost in The Shell's live-action western adaptation surgically removes the challenging, iconic aspects of the source material, replacing them with abrasively generic fluff. The visuals and soundtrack may dazzle some, but those are elements that can be enjoyed without watching the actual movie. The actual meat of the film, as in the writing, story, directing, and more, are all executed with an offensively cookie-cutter mentality that seems focused not on adapting the source material, but rather disrespecting and misunderstanding it. Comparisons to the original aside, this one fails even on its own merits; it's indefensibly below-average and, at times, rather offensive.",2
  Endless destroyed trash than hollywood has turned every single live action western anime adaptation into. Trash. This is too much for a coincidence.,2
"  I don't know what everyone is banging on about, purists no doubt I thought it did a great job. There's nothing about it I didn't like! Feel bad it got a mediocre response I'd recommend it. Maybe there could have been some more complexity to the plot as it's a thriller at heart, slightly predictable but not enough not for me to be engaged throughout, I thought the balance between action and themes and imagery was very well handled and the casting was great too. And a great length at 1.47 pleased to see a film not fanny around like the good old days",4
"  Ghost in a Shell is an adopted screenplay by an Anime character, this character is played by Scarlet Johansson. She was very good in this movie but it was a bit complicated. I felt like I was watching Bladerunner and the Matrix. It had very good scene-metric futuristic special effects from one scene to the next, loved it. Overall it was good movie, but kept waiting for it to be over with.",2
"  Expected nothing more from a whitewashed casting. My review may be narrow-minded and lacking depths, but so was the casting choice.",0
"  Realy liked it, would have been great, if it would have staid closer to the Anime.. The Carst was great!! It has to be warched more then once to be appitiated.. Same applied to the Anime.. I love, how they refferenced to Mamoru Oshi!!!",5
  This is the best live action adaptation of an anime that I have seen. It ACCURATELY portrays all the characters as they were shown in the anime and adhears to the storyline.,5
"  Good and beautiful sci if Movie. Yeah, I liked the original too but who cares,this is a new interpretation.",4
  Similar enough to the source material to make it not a boring remake. Surprisingly alot better than I had thought. Movie goers are so spoiled these days.,5
  Very good act of scarlett johanson,5
"  10/10, BEST MOVIE i'VE EVER SEEN. gREAT STORYLINE, GREAT GRAPHICS.",5
"  Here is the thing about adaptations; they are not always good. There are two things that can go wrong when a director decides to do one. One, the original message gets interpreted wrong; and two, it gets so perverted that the original message doesn't get relayed properly. The live action adaptation of Ghost in the Shell has the latter of the two problems. The end of the movie, in words; says what I believe the original message of the animated movie was all about. The story they went with, the characters, and the overall feel of the movie does not convey this at all. It is not who we are, or our physical traits or nationality or even our gender what make us human, it is our soul; or in this case our ghosts; and our experiences is what defines us and makes us human. That's what the movie tells you in words. But what I got from it is who you were biologically is what makes us human. That is totally off the mark to me what the animated movie was all about. The point of the animated movie was that no matter how mechanized we become as humans, we are still humans because our souls remain with us, even if that line gets blurred in the process. In a perfect world; I could look at this movie and say ""You know, the adaptation doesn't always have to remain faithful to the source material. The director can put their own spin on what they believe the source material was going for in order to make it their own."" But realistically, I look at this movie; and I can't help but feel disappointed. An adaptation doesn't have to follow the source material one hundred percent, and therein lies the problem with adaptations. The Webster definition of an adaptation is a composition rewritten into a new form; a screen adaptation of a novel. Now what does that mean? It means you take that written or video work; and you can adapt it in order to make it your own without outright copying the work; or trying to claim it as your own. That would be plagiarizing, and that's bad. While the movie is a good adaptation by definition; in reality it is terrible. It is terrible because this movie already exists. The animated movie was done better, and the message of the work was portrayed better; and it really made you think. All this movie did was make me think I wasted my time watching this terrible movie. If you are going to make a live action adaptation of an animated work, you need to make it better than the original, or add something that further enhances the message. For anyone who hasn't seen the animated movie; it is about a Section 9 operative named Major Kusanagi (everyone just calls her Major). Her job is to fight cyber terrorism. Now because this universe takes place in a world where a majority of the population has a lot of cybernetic enhancements, and androids are a very real thing; that definition extends to a lot of things. Like human brains being hacked as an example. A crime happens where an ambassador of some kind is having tea at a robot geisha house. He gets attacked and... oh wait; I confused the start of the animated movie with the animated series, and apparently so did the director. I also want to point out that the animated series (Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex) is different enough from the animated movie that it can be considered its own thing. Not only does it explain the universe of Ghost in the Shell a lot better than the movie does; it also gives bits of backstory of who the Major is. So what the live action movie does is pick and choose scenes and events from both the animated movie and the animated series; and mashes it together to make a movie, but it doesn't do that well either. The Major is also apparently some Asian girl who was taken and made into a cyborg without consent by some big evil mega corporation named Hanka Corp or whatever. Doesn't really matter because the plot is adapted as poorly as the movie was. In the animated movie, Section 9 is trying to find and capture a hacker named The Puppet Master. But you find out the hacker is actually a sentient AI made by Section 6, and they are trying to cover it up because somehow the AI escaped and is trying to survive. It also has the hots for the Major because it wants to meld their ghosts together to make something even better than human. Along the way they explore themes of human existence, and what it means to be human, are you still human if you copy all your memories as data and copy it to a cybernetic brain. The live action movie treats completely cybernetics humans like the Major as a rare thing, but in the animated movie it is pretty common, and a fully biological human with no enhancements is super rare; hence ""what is humanity"" is such a strong thing to ask in a world where cybernetic enhancements is commonplace. The plot of the live action movie is The Major gets turned into a cyborg but has a human brain, and this is the start of them doing this. An employee of the company gets attacked and hacked because the aforementioned AI from the animated movie is trying to get information on all the employees involved in the project that involve The Major being created. But you find out he's not an AI but a failed version of the Major and he's trying to kill everyone involved in the project for revenge and blah blah blah. I feel like this plot mostly consists of getting all of the really amazing cinematography from both the animated series and the animated movie and making them look really amazing in live action. They do that pretty well, and the fighting scenes are pretty good as well. If this were a standalone movie it would actually be pretty good; but it can't be because it is being compared with the animated movie, and that is far superior. Her name in the movie and the animated series is Motoko Kusanagi, which is good but it just feels wrong because The Major on the animated movie knows who and what she is and is a total bad-ass. In this Scarlett Johansson does a really good job at being a bad-ass; and does her best with what she's got, but the character feels like she is written like a kid trying to get use to her new body. At one point she finds a human and is like ""oh so this is what a human feels like"". What?! No that's just stupid; but because they wrote her as having fake memories with a tragic backstory to motivate her, this could be seen as normal to her. The rest of the characters are OK. I could have gotten used to how Batou looked in this. But then they gave him his robot eyes and he just looks so stupid! What the hell guys, like it would have probably look better if they were bigger and more in his head like in the animated movie, but in this he just looks creepy and weird!! I came into this with an open mind, but I just couldn't take it by the end of it. They do such a horrible job with the plot and how they just insert different scenes from both the series and the animated movie; that at one point the movie became painful to watch. If you are curious to watch this movie just to see how they manage to ruin yet another adaptation to an animated property; then by all means watch this movie. But be warned, this movie will infuriate you. Or you'll just laugh the whole time. Hopefully you get that reaction from this; I certainly wish I had.",2
"  Great movie. Do not pay attention to bad critics, this movie is definitely worth your time.Although the plot drifts away a bit from the original anime, it is still good. You will find yourself emotionally invested and you will wish that movie lasted just a bit longer. Great acting, fantastic cast, excellent director, simply a movie to enjoy.Oh, and do not get duped by ""whitewashing"" snowflakes, Scarlet is simply the perfect choice. Some Asian actress would do a fine job, I am sure of it, but Johansson fits in perfectly. She certainly deserved the role and we should be grateful that Scarlet continues to grace the screens with sci-fi roles. Great work should not know the skin color. Leave the politics and quotas out of the movies.",4
"  Quite why critics decided to pour hate on this particular film I couldn't say, but the nonsense about ""whitewashing"" that was carted around in the press in a successful effort to discredit the film and ruin any chance of it being successful was clearly a targeted effort. The notion that a film which employed several Asian actors in major roles was bad for Hollywood diversity is a crock of whatever. Perhaps if they looked at films where the cast are entirely white, or ones where the only P.O.C are criminals as well as films like this or Doctor Strange for that matter it might seem like they genuinely care, as it is it just seems vindictive. As to the film, 5 out of 5, easily. Fantastic story, well retold by a brilliant cast and with outstanding effects, reminiscent of everything that was great about blade runner, while maintaining everything that makes Japanese storytelling so compulsive. If you haven't seen this because of the critical smear campaign, put it aside and get hold of a copy, you won't regret it. My anger is borne of the frustration that we will probably never see a sequel because of its reception, it so deserved one.",5
"  Succeeds as a live-action anime, but offers little of anything else.",2
"  Thought this was going to be bad from the previews, but was pleasantly surprised by the movie. As a fan of the original Anime, I enjoyed how much respect they showed towards it. People who haven't seen the anime might not appreciate how close this is to it.",4
"  This movie was white wash at its finest. I remember watching the anime on this. This movie is what American movies always do to a foreign original. It utterly destroys it. Anything that is from a foreign country, mainly Japan, America has a tendency to ruin the whole thing. Regardless of if its a manga, anime or a horror movie. They'll take them, and make them less about story. And, make them more about what they want to put in. This movie was the same thing.",1
"  As a fan of the original Japanese manga as well as films and tv series, this attempt by Western Hollywood to capture the essence, is a complete failure and this movie is utter crap.",1
"  I quite liked this movie. I've read the manga and watched them movies and enjoyed the overall visuals and premise. The whitewashing thing is rather pathetic in that the anime and manga made the main character's shell western while beautifully maintaining eastern cultural visuals, characters and concepts throughout. The movie cast was quite close to the original characters. The only criticism I have is that the story behind the ""ghost"" gets lost, unlike the original stories.",4
"  A Japanese girl's brain is transplanted into Scarlett Johansson's robot body. What I liked- Visually appealing. - Great style. - Scarlett Johansson, Pilou AsbaekNitpicks- Cutter is a weak villain. - Kuze is kind of letdown. - Could have been better. - Forgettable film. - Underwhelming. - Has no heart. Final Thoughts- It was no Blade Runner 2049. - I can see why The Matrix was influenced by this. - It looks like it was setting up for a sequel. - An all Japanese cast would have been interesting. I don't know the source material. I suspect the manga is better.",2
"  Horrible deviation from the source material. If you are a fan of any of the source material, DO NOT WATCH THIS.",0
  Awful film... I stopped watching it because the Major is supposed to be headstrong and reeks confidence... yet what I see is she's portrayed as a confused soul who plays the victim card. I cringed on my seat... NOT WORTH IT!,0
"  This is probably very simple: You're a fan of the original? It will most likely be anything from mildly disappointing to decent. You've never seen the original and don't know much about it? It will most likely be anything from decent to wildly entertaining. Going into more depth, personally, I was surprised at how it wasn't anywhere near as bad as I was expecting it to be. Not great, but not terrible, either. With a high-production value that allows for a stunningly built world with superb visuals and great attention to detail, as well as some pretty entertaining action sequences (including 4 or 5 of the most iconic moments from the original, which I was pleased to see), it has its merits. That being said, the negatives do outweigh the positives. The story is over-simplified, has an underwhelming conclusion, and contains none of the deeper meaning or philosophy of the original, something that is absolutely essential, as far as I'm concerned. Yeah, those are some big cons. What stood out the most, however, was just how badly the writers have not only failed to capture the individuality of Section 9's team members, but also the unique interactions between them - none of them have any depth or character; in fact, most of them didn't seem to matter, at all.Now the casting could be said to be somewhat questionable in a couple of instances, depending on who you ask, but the one that got the most heat prior to the film's release - Scarlett Johannson's casting -- turned out to be one of the better decisions once I discovered that they have found a plausible way around comparisons to the iconic Kusanagi. Apart from that, Pilou Asbæk made a pretty darn perfect Batou, and Beat Takeshi and Juliette Binoche are almost always great in whatever they do.All in all, this is one of those instances where you're probably going to have a better time if you haven't seen the original, but for fans of it, this is never going to compare and can only ever amount to a weak copy, at best, of an outstanding original.",2
"  initiate project 2571..Ghost In The ShellIt is perfect for all the comic fans as the throwbacks to all the sketchy characters, unusual powers and the origin story is depicted in here but in terms of an individual feature it barely gives you a lose thread to hold on to it. Rupert Sanders' execution skills are surprisingly good but unfortunately the script didn't have enough material to feed off the audience for more than 100 minutes. Scarlett Johansson seems like a good choice to cast upon on such a role and her effort is appreciative too but despite of revolving the tale completely around her, the script doesn't offer enough range to flaunt her skills on screen. Ghost In The Shell has a decent background score, amazing visual effects and stunning make-up artist behind it but addition to that it doesn't have anything fresh in terms of plotline or even action sequences which is usually essential in such features that relies a lot upon such stuff.",1
"  This movie deserves a decent review. Besides the white sexy oRhere were a few contractions Scarlett's ""shell"" and a few situationally over dramatic acting, the plot line is exceptional. Above average. Well planned. Well executedThe star attraction of this movie has to be the special effects; only someone abjectly creative could conjure such an otherworldly futuristic place; set in with original machinery that impressed me. Only momentarily does the action slow down. There were a few minor contradictions in the script , yet all around happily overlooked as there is so much to look at in this film.",4
"  Watch this only for the visuals or Scarlett, otherwise stick to the manga for the story",2
  In Ghost in the Shell aus dem Jahr 2017 geht es um eine Frau deren Gehirn in einen künstlichen Körper transplantiert wird und die dann für die Regierung arbeitet. Der Film ist spannend und die visuellen Effekte sehen sehr gut aus. Regie führte Rupert Sanders. Scarlett Johansson spielt ihre Rolle hervorragend. Ein guter Science-Fiction Film.,4
"  Nothing seemed to click in this one, despite it having a somewhat better narrative.",1
"  Aesthetically pleasing, great action scenes and Scarlett Johansson and Juliette Binoche were acting brilliantly. A must watch.",4
  Changed too much from the anime for me to like it.,2
"  I actually really enjoyed this. I vaguely remember the anime, but it seems like the crucial components have made the transition. It's a visually stimulating movie with just enough plot to keep you watching and wanting more. Based on the reviews, I doubt a sequel will emerge though. I'm not sure why there's so much negativity towards this movie, when a movie like Blade Runner gets rave reviews.",4
  Loved it! Held my attention beautifully and the visual effects and acting was great!,4
"  Whitewashing gripes aside, GITS was a very cool and fun ride. The futuristic setting had great visuals and atmosphere, and the cast did a good enough job that anyone watching without prior knowledge of the source material could interpret the plot sufficiently.",4
  Boring plot but a ok action sci-fi flick. Would be better if knew more back story on the characters.,2
  Do not believe the criticsWatch this movie - it is AMAZINgIt will blow you awayIt will give you strength It delivers on every level,5
"  decent remake, downvoted by people who don't know what they want.",4
"  Even if I had never seen the original, the first thing that would have hit me about this is the completely generic plot. Fancy visuals don't cover up a plot that boils down to a ""who am I"" investigation and a mild government cover-up. Knowing the source material simply makes it worse, since the original was more of a meditation on what it meant to be human and the evolution beyond. All that was squashed in favor of retread of what dozens if not hundreds of better movies have done. It's not really bad, but it is completely forgettable, and that's even worse.",1
"  I've watched the original movie, it's sequel 'innocence', and I practically grew up with 'stand alone complex'. But watching this was just painful.This movie sacrifices deep themes and questions of oneself in favour of a generic 'betrayed super soldier'. A tired, over used, lazy & outright disrespectful film.Outside of pretty visuals (which aren't even that interesting either) this film is a hollow shell.",1
  I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
"  The special effects were incredible, but the slow pace and boring overall story definitely hurt.",2

"  I got a free ticket to see Ghost in the Shell. And good thing, too. It was dull. But just in case you forgot which movie you were watching, they showed you the title twice in the opening credits. That was already a bad sign.I never cared about anything that was going on and Major Motoko's character was completely wrong.Also, everybody either mumbles, has a thick accent, or sounds disinterested. It makes it very hard to follow without concentrating.Seing the visuals and designs from the anime movie was cool, and some of the characters were their actual badass selves for a fleeting moment, but that was it. Everything else was poorly written.Just skip this one and watch the original or the Stand Alone Complex TV show instead.",1
"  Horrible movie, uninspired. Great visual effects. The movie was quite literally a shell without it's ghost. Don't bother watching.",0
"  A bit of a guilty pleasure. This Scarlett Johannsen vehicle does take a while to get going, and it's just a wee bit too dark lighting wise, but the story starts kickinh in, and it gets really interesting. Plus this is a visual design marvel.",4

  Not much to say Ghost in a Shell starts as an iconic sci-fi thriller but ends like a deflated balloon,2
"  Nice visuals, and seems on the verge of being intelligent and interesting, but it doesn't quite seem to get there. Add to that people acting like robots, mild character development and a uninspired score.",2

"  Excellent interpretation of the originals. Different of course, it is live action. ScarJo is perfect and delivers a VG performance as usual.",4
"  Very actual reflexion on transhumanism. While a lot of science fiction movies are for amusement, this one has a very strong philosophical basis, an extrapolation of today's reality and AI upcoming.",5
"  Many people seem shocked, shocked that a remake of a movie isn't exactly the same as the original; As if that's a thing with remakes. This was a close enough to the original to enjoy the sentiment againyet different enough to enjoy on it's own merits.",4
"  Too late to come out to impress its fans!It was not my most anticipated film of the year. Like usual for any film, I just wanted to see it and enjoy it. The film was fine, but that does not mean so good. From the visuals to the performances, it sounded great. But the story wasn't. When the original concept was created nearly 30 years back, it fascinated people for being something new and powerful. But for the current world, for the current generation, it is just an ordinary sci-fi. All I say is it just came out at least 15 years late. So the 90s kids would have loved it!The storyline was nothing, but a self-discovery of a half human, half machine. This has been the plot of hundreds of robot films. But it's just differently told. One of only kind, a human brain was saved after the severe accident and given an artificial body. Now she's known as Major fights the crime. But some day later, she's haunted by glitches in her vision which directly connected to her past that she does not remember. The rest of the film was finding the truth and other consequences, before it all ends.Visual effects were the only advantage for this film to come out in the present era. The rest of the film was simply okayish. I don't know what the original source fans say about it, but it is a one time watchable film. Otherwise, there are plenty of similar good films, like this is nothing much different than 'Robocop'. Or the recent TV series 'Westworld'. Scarlett Johansson could become a reason for some people to peek into it. The writing and direction were average. Watch and forget kind of film.5/10",2
"  Not a great film at all. Was hoping for better. The visuals were very ""Blade Runner"". The best part of the film was spotting Hong Kong.",2
"  Was absolutely bored throughout this movie, nothing happened and when something was building up it just went cya and fucked off back to walking around. The only mild entertainment was staring at Scarlett Johansson. All style but no plot. I also haven't seen the anime nor do I ever plan to.",1
  even the great scenery can't save this adaptation from whitewashing and cliches that flood this movie.,1
"  Stunning visuals but the storyline falls flat. The are a few reasons that it didn't work. The worst issue is the lack of focus in the storyline. The magic of the original was that it explored the nature of self in a world where the nature of the mind ro soul was hard to define. The revenge element crowbarred into the live action version just takes away from the overall goal of this story, to make the view ask ""What defines me?"".Next is the characture of the Major. The original Major was damaged by the fact that she not only allowed but asked to have her ghost transfefered to a synthetic body. Her fear of losing self was due to that fact. The rebooted Major lacked the strength of characture that the original Major had.",2
  I have to day... I thought it was pretty awesome. Went with low expectations and came out smiling. The film is beautifull and serves as a back story. I also thought that the section leader did a great job!,4
"  Beautiful movie, the story left me wondering where it would lead up until the end.",5
  terrible....she needs to stop doing action movies,0
"  The film's visuals are where everything works at it's best, but it's lack of focus on the writing, it's indifference to narrative structure and it's unavoidable casting issues make this something that's harder to watch than it should be. It's no shock to me that this film bombed financially and critically, it's an absolute shock to me that they could screw it up this much.",1
  I'd give this a zero.,0
  Scarlett Johansson's acting is very poor.,0
"  Spoilers: A brilliant movie that could have easily became a brilliant series of movies. Set up in a way so that the events of the movie didn't quite go the way of the anime (to leave the writers more wiggle room to explore the character in future installments, clearly) it was still obviously being set so it could evolve in parallel with the anime. All the threads of the plot are heading in the same direction, just designed to get there a little slower. Had it not been in the center of a storm in a teacup then future movies would have been able to fill in the gaps. For example, Major doesn't immediately take up the antagonists offer to merge (which would have caused her to become someone else at the end of the movie), but it's clear he has become part of her, leaving the option open for them to merge later once we've had more time with Major. It was clear they wanted to do more than just a one off, but were instead hoping to create an interesting cyberpunk universe more fully exploring the major, but sadly we only saw one installment thanks to all the complaining. Any prospect of a followup was killed by insufferable whiners. It's funny but the people who complained about 'whitewashing' are pulling a 'scanner darkly' on themselves. The same people who need an American to be in a movie before they can relate to that movie, have now convinced themselves that there's a conspiracy and that the very American they need, who they themselves literally cause to be in the movie in the first place (by reasons of demographic), who is there specifically for them (for them to relate to).... is actually there for nefarious and sinister conspiracy reasons. Which is hilarious. American anime fans are going to create an environment in which less studios are willing to take the risk on live action versions of anime. Going forward, we're going to see a world in which movies won't feature anyone these people need in order to relate to it (so they can avoid accusations of whitewashing), and do poorly as a result, or are going to feature someone these audiences can relate to and but whined into oblivion. Talk about a lack of self awareness. American anime fans are setting themselves up to become the plot of a scanner darkly; where they think they have their sights trained on something sinister they can investigate but are actually investigating themselves.",5
  Very nice and modern adaptation of the original movie.,4
  Pretty standard IP milking junk.Entertaining viewing.Empty of meaning.Absolutely forgettable.,2
"  Lo que parecía ser una propuesta muy interesante en el 2017 con un cine dominado completamente por los superhéroes, Ghost in the Shell con un ambiente cyberpunk muy llamativo, termino siendo una total decepción, una una trama completamente fumada nos presentan la historia de major una androide cuyo cuerpo fue totalmente reconstruido trata de averiguar sus orígenes, hasta aquí ningún problema, el problema surge cuando se desarrolla la trama y nos presentan a los personajes, fallan totalmente en ese aspecto, el antagonista es completamente innecesario, inclusive parece ser un personaje de relleno y la probé Scarlett Johansson está sexualizada a más no poder.",1
  2017's 'Ghost In The Shell' is ugly. The performances are dull and the story is flat. One cannot comprehend how the people responsible for this film did not foresee how diluting the source material in order to appeal to the lowest common denominator would fail to hold newcomers and alienate fans.,1
"  Not a good adaptation of original series let alone being a decent sci-fi film at it's level of budget.Judging solely on a production of sci-fi, again, to it's similar budget, in comparison of recent years of sci-fi films like Edge of tomorrow[also adapted from Japan], this one is a bummer and make me want to walk out of the cinema which I never felt needed to in my 30 years of film watching.Why? it missed that only thing important to a sci-fi film, to spent more resource and effects to make it believable, which it failed.This movie only brings the skin of a fascinating background to life, that's why the still image looks fine, but anything else was awful in continuum.It lacks of physics that can make audience feel natural, for example, the tacky directed character walks, tacky action scenes, less to none professional guidance on weaponry and martial arts, poor practical & 3d effect considering the budget , introduce us an elite strike force but end result looks like amateurs playing laser tag.What's worst is that the adapted source and other similar films ""in the past"" didn't make this mistake, original source over 20 years ago and recent adaptation film ""Edge of tomorrow"" did the 'believable' world just fine, stayed focus to the settings of physics resulted in well produced entertaining film.Ghost in the Shell 2017, somehow a director wasting resource and can not make a sci-fi world believable despite others did it with same or less budget, making actors look like first time cos-players, waste budget, waste actors, waste other film maker's past experience, waste of audiance's time watching.",0

  Lame remake of the manga. Thoroughly misses the reflexions that made the original so thought provoking. Of course visual effects were great but that does not make a great movie. Scarlett interpretation was rather disappointing... but the director of Section 9 best actor in the movie.,0

"  The film may have a nice soundtrack, decent visuals, and breathtaking shots, but when it comes to the story, it's nothing compared to the anime it's based on. ""Ghost in the Shell"" suffers from a weak story and a ludicrous performance made by Scarlett Johansson who doesn't seem to understand that she's a robot, not an actress trying to be a robot. Seriously, her walks felt forced and not as robotic as David's from ""Prometheus."" The whole plot twist and where the story was going can be seen from a mile away. It's not as intelligent or as original as it's counterpart because it doesn't question our reality if we were controlled by machines, but if it did, then this movie would have been a straight rip-off to ""Blade Runner."" I guess that's why the story was weak?",2
  Really shame atempt to do something which is original and ended up as american stupid dumdown atempt with multi culti wibe. You should leave it as original is like thousand times better.,2

"  Ghost in the Shell is a simply a mediocre film, there's not much to say to be honest, it's fine and that's about it. It admittedly has brilliant visuals, some neat action sequences and decent score but that doesn't make it a good film. The problem is it's just rather boring, it has some brilliant concepts but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. The first two acts ask some really interesting questions but don't really have any answers and the third act just descends into a generic action sequence, consisting of bad looking cgi smashing into each other. There's just nothing really to talk about, it leaves a lot to be desired and is so boring that it is a difficult watch. I haven't seen the anime so I can't compare it to the original or judge but as a stand alone film it's just rather generic. I really have to stress this film isn't terrible but it isn't very good which is a shame as it had lots of great potential and does have a good opening. Just at the end of the day mediocre. C",2

"  Faithful in spirit, and style to the 1995 Anime masterpiece, but differing somewhat in The Major's backstory (though by the end of the film, half of that is resolved), and the plot is a little more about what it means to be human, writ large, but isn't as much about sentient AI, whether simply thinking and having memories means you have rights or not, but IS about human dignity, how memory shapes how we think of ourselves, but asserts that ultimately it's what you do with that information that defines you, not where you started. The supporting cast is strong, it's a GORGEOUS looking movie, and the actor who had the role of the director of Section 9 is WONDERFUL. His scenes are true film noir.While the film isn't quite as smart as it's source material, it still has the same soul and setting, and is, I think, a little easier to relate to than the original. It's a shame it's not resonating with more people. I'm NOT a ScarJo fan, but I can't deny she did really well here.Update: the dialogue is weak and the big change in plot is that it is more idiosyncratic than it should be.",4
"  Scarlett Johansson stars in the sci-fi techno-thriller Ghost in the Shell. The story follows a cyborg named Major Mira who works for an elite police task force that's tracking a cyber terrorist, but the investigation takes a strange turn when Mira starts experiencing glitches and begins to question her memories. Unfortunately Johansson gives a rather lackluster performance, and the rest of the cast pretty weak. Also, the plot is convoluted and drops the audience into a strange dystopic future without taking the time to explain any of it. However, the film has an incredibly rich and stylistic visual aesthetic. The costume and set designs, along with the special effects, make for a remarkably interesting futuristic look. And the action scenes are dynamic and well-choreographed. Yet while it's entertaining and a marvel to look at, Ghost in the Shell is a mess of a film that's formulaic and full of stereotypical sci-fi tropes.",4
"  The movie is a very entertaining thriller with good actors and exciting action sequences. While die hard fans of the film and comic may find some issues with consistency in the plot and world created by the director. It is indisputable that the film lives on its own. As long time reader of the comic I did find this discrepancies a bit sad, but not enough to prevent me to enjoy this visually stunning adaptation. A exciting experience that not quite match the original but yet rewards the viewer. I will definitely recommend it to anyone who seeks a fresh approach to sci-fi.",2
  of course i went in wanting to like this. it has great visuals but the movie is really just meh. didn't care about the story or the characters at all.,2
"  I'm not the anime guy. So this takes place in the future. Like most stories with a science fiction angle, robotic technology has made drastic developments. This is about a girl that survived a near-death experience (Scarlett Johansson). She gets saved and has her brain placed in a robot body (insert Sealab 2021 joke here). She works for the police to take down dangerous criminals, but when is she going to learn about her true history? Now I can't speak for the anime or the manga because I don't have the experience, nor do I have that kind of time. Nevertheless, I figured I would still check out the big budget CliffsNotes of a largely popular property. While I did like the underlying setup to this, it only ended up bringing an amnesia story we have seen countless times before to the table. Now this may seem like loftier praise than I am actually giving, but in style, this reminded me a lot of Blade Runner. This makes sense, though, as it is not all that uncommon for science fiction properties to borrow from one another, sometimes in theme and sometimes just in spirit. Even though this has its own feel to it, you still can't shake what a retread this story is of many other superior films that you have seen before. There have been many that have been complaining that this is another example of Hollywood whitewashing; I went into this knowing what the big third act twist was, and it should have made me angrier, but it didn't if I am being honest. It just makes it feel more of a studio movie more than anything, which must be frustrating for the director, who clearly placed forth a lot of time and effort. There is a lot about Ghost in the Shell that I feel gets lost in translation. I like this story about where science ends and humanity begins, but it only plays a small part into this. The script to this gets clunky, and this a one of the very rare movies where I think that Scarlett Johansson is pretty bad in her role, which is due with her being unsure of how to emote as a robotic character. This is a no-win situation, because outsiders like me are going to be off put with the end product, and people who love the property are just going to feel like they should have just rewatched the originals that they fell in love with years ago.",2
"  Great adaptation of the original anime source material, Scarlett Johansson is beautiful and deadly in the existentially spiced action play.",5
"  Wooden performances by Scarlett Johanssen and the main cast did nothing to secure my interest in this big screen adaptation of the manga series. Interestingly enough, some of the supporting cast members came across as much more authentic and believable. I gave this an extra half-star for the excellent 'Bladerunner-like' inner city environment. Unfortunately, the movie as a whole had no ghost (soul).",2
"  Saw Scarlett almost naked, but the movie still sucked!",2
  Uhm..efeitos especiais excelentes...roteiro...estranho......,2
"  Visually stunning, but the storytelling just isn't that compelling.",2
  Visually cool but too slow to be entertaining.,2
"  This is a great opening, we have never seen how the major came to be and this will do quite nicely, both the cast and direction was spot on, now all we need is a two part follow up using the laughing man as the protagingast keep everything the same +100And a big thank you to cast and crew :)",5
"  Unlike the manga and anime the story was a little short on the emotional and explanatory side, but I believe that is due to screen time of the movie. Otherwise I loved it , the visuals and both the music and acting were great . Compared to all the other adaptations of anime and manga this exceeded my expectations!",5
  What a fucking waste. All that energy and vibrant atmosphere completely abandoned in the most lackluster climax I have seen in an action movie. They even ditch the narrative about AI reaching sentience that made the original film so compelling and instead give us a very simple story that I didnt need to see again. And dear lord didnt Hollywood learn from Wild Wild West that mechanical spiders make shit enemies?! I see so much hard work on the screen put towards something completely useless. Just watch the original.,1
  Very disappointing the movie had a lot of potential but bad directing and screenplay didn't give justice to original. Another aspect that dissapointed was the lacklustering soundtrack ..they had the base for it but they completely ignored it.,2
  Couldn't stay awake. Boring,1
"  Amazing visuals, compelling story, passes the Bechdel test.",4
"  Drenched in neon and CGI-fueled, ""Ghost in the Shell"" proposes the idea of keeping humanity intact in a world of technology, and yet manages to lose its own.Dull, plodding, and bizarre, the film dutifully plays out scenes for fans of the anime and spends time prepping for the overseas market, but never bothers giving newcomers a reason to care.",2
  FUCK YOU STEVEN PAUL,0
  Not amazing but far from disappointing.,4
"  For a futuristic concept movie this looks dated despite stunning FX. The concept of everywhere looking like Hong Kong on steroids was last fashionable in the 80s. There is precious little of the William Gibson vibe considering the Cyber themes. In fact, take out the Hoopla visuals and you have a so-so Anti-Terrorist plot.Scarlett puts in a fair effort at acting all discombobulated but at times it was like the Black Widow had done some intense carbo loading!Plus points were the faithful transitions from the Manga, esp Beat Takeshi as the enigmatic Boss. Wakarimas?",2
"  Visually, Rupert Sanders's adaptation of 'Ghost in the Shell' is stunning, featuring gorgeous cinematography and mind-blowing CGI, oh and of course Scarlett Johansson - but then there's EVERYTHING else about it.Firstly, don't get me wrong, 'Ghost in the Shell' is not a bad film, but equally it's far from being an excellent film, maybe just balancing above mediocre, and the reason for this is down to the clichéd and convoluted storyline, underdeveloped two-dimensional characters and lack of relation to its source material - but as I stated above, visually this film is a marvel. The original version of 'Ghost in the Shell' was one of the first anime films I ever had the chance to see, and whilst it does delve into the ""weird"" side of anime at parts, it is nonetheless an abstract piece of art and still stands the test of time as one of the finest anime films, however this will never come near that.So what are the memorable qualities in this film? Um, there's, um... well there's Scarlett Johansson when she... um... yeah. Virtually nothing. It depicts a metropolitan future on an almost frightening note - but that's been done before time and time again. In this future, around 70% of humanity have cyborg-like alterations made to their body, and the general vistas of the city, whilst stunning, add an almost claustrophobic quality to them. Tight smothering streets, and enough fluorescent lights to make 'Blade Runner' jealous.The story itself is rather straight forward, a woman is cybernetically-enhanced and forced to act as a weapon to prevent the occurrence of ""terrorism"" and ""hacking"", however along the way she begins to uncover more about her past and how she became the titular ""ghost in the shell"". But the problem is, this plot is clichéd to hell, and characters dash in and out of the story never having any real relevance within the movie's world, including the concluding villain (don't worry, no spoilers here). It tries to be smart, but just ends up convoluted and over-blown.All-in-all it's a fair attempt at an adaptation, which is more than can be said for Sanders's film before. But it just falls short in too many places to really make its mark as a sci-fi great. If we were just there for the visuals, this film would be near-masterful, but that's not the case here.",0
"  this is was alright with me but look okay and nicest done, this one whole like original anime movie and TV Series. but its not look great but its pretty fun sci-fi action movie. but its pretty weird this movie supposed to be Rated R from the original anime film but in the sequel in Dreamwork give this sequel in PG-13(Ghost in the Shell 2). Scarlett Johansson done well playing Major Mira Killian/Motoko Kusanagi in this film, but I look it up about her she played Mindy from Nickelodeon Movie The SpongeBob Squarepants Movie and of course she played Black Widow from Marvel's Studios The Avengers no wonder why. but this movie is better than Dragonball Evolution",4
"  Ghost in the shell is a live-action ADAPTION of Masamune Shirow manga series and Mamoru Oshii anime film works and this movie is indeed one of the best film adaption from anime to live action ( in america ) in the world. Sarlett Johnson killed it as major same goes to the cast but one thing that's not bad but bad-ish is the main villain i'm not going to spoiled is a bit wooded, like the idea to make a laughing man/ puppet master mix but not really intended. the world of this film is an eye drug, its so amazing to look at almost recreating the world that Masamune Shirow and Mamoru Oshii made, its so good. that it's i hope this film gets a cult following. i'm a huge fan the the manga and anime so trust me.",4
"  Great movie. The plot takes elements from the entire franchise, the original anime, the anime series and sequel to build a plot very similar to the original but more centered around the origin of the major while still presenting the concepts of personhood and what makes us human. Visuals are very well realized, with many scenes closely resembling the anime with avoiding looking overly bombastic or pushing us out of the suspense of disbelief. the movie has good casting and Johanson plays major very well, all tho it took me a moment to get on board with the portrayal of her cop buddy Batou, which was much easier when he got his new eyes. If you liked the anime full motion picture and dont expect this to be 1 to 1 carbon copy, you should enjoy this movie.",4
"  As someone who hadn't seen the anime version or read the graphic novels/manga before seeing this film,.. I thought this movie had awesome visual effects that kept the resemblance of the anime look and feel. It also had a great story from start to finish. I was engaged the entire time. If I were a purest and one of my favorite movies was being redone, I suppose I'd be irritated if it didn't live up to my expectations as far as keeping to the same exact plot as the original, but I wouldn't vote down an otherwise great movie. Unfortunately I think that's what a lot of long time fans did. If you aren't familiar with any of the original Ghost in The Shell art work, then I think you'll find the film to be well worth a couple hours of your time. Now I'm thinking about how long I should wait before I watch it again.",4
  Terrible. I had no idea what was going on the entire time. I was trying as hard as I could to keep my eyes open.,0
"  Major Motoko Kusanagi is unique, a human brain implanted in a robot's body. This, the intelligence of a human combined with the physical qualities of a machine, has enabled her to be the ultimate crime fighter. Now she faces her ultimate enemy: Kuze, a criminal who has managed to hack into the brains of androids and control them.The original, animated Ghost in the Shell from 1995 was very good, with a decent plot, great action scenes and some interesting themes. (Not brilliant though, lest you think my views on the first movie are influencing my view of this one).This, the 2017 movie, is not even close to that movie. This doesn't come close to the coherence of plot and theme-development of the first movie. This leaves it basically a (largely CGI-driven) action movie with a very simple (yet somehow confusing) plot and not much in the way of profundity. It also makes it quite dull.",2
"  Boring, convoluted, lacks all the magic of the original, hard to follow, poor cgi, over the top graphics, no information given to audience, poor film",0
  Story is not new but acting and visual effects are superb. Reminds me greatly of first BLADE RUNNER in story and ambience.,4
"  Truly unexceptional. Borderline boring. The story is poorly written, which sinks the whole ship. Scarlet J was a poor choice as well. She was like a beer that had been left out in the sun for 5 hours. Flat. The only interesting character (Pilou Asbaek) got his human eyes replaced with cold, black robot eyes; so for the rest of the movie it was hard to feel a connection with him. Wouldn't watch this again. Regret the two hours I spent.",1
"  Although I enjoyed the original anime I always found the story to be a bit lacking, I think the film improved on this actually with a more clear narrative and a consistent pace. The film is worth a watch simply for the amazing art direction, the attention to detail is incredible and just like the anime it's a fun journey into a futuristic Asian inspired world.I think overall it's very underrated and likely due to people's distorted memories of the anime (which IMO was always lacking in story despite how amazing it looked, I far preferred Akira as it was less pretentious). It could also be that people objected to Scarlet Johansson being the lead but I think she was the best person for this role, it's really made for her and her ability to fill the role with excellence is more important to me than her skin color, I would hope the original creators of the franchise would agree.",4
"  The visuals are truly impressive, however the story surrounding it is, simply put, quite bland and dull. Unfortunately, it does not live up to its animated source material.",2
"  ""Dumb."" <--- an apt review.",1
"  Just didn't do anything for me. Disjointed plot, dubious casting and simply boring. I am not sure who to even blame.",2
"  A visually striking movie, great story line, kept elements of the anime movie and tv series while adding new twists.",5
"  I am a great supporter of Hollywood productions that explore Asian themes and take place in Asian settings. For all the people out there boycotting this movie because of its white-washed casting, Please Do Not Boycott This Movie! Or This Type of Movie! This is an excellently made film - from its poignant storytelling, to its stunning images. We should support films that have Asian themes. If we boycott such movies, Hollywood will make even less of movies like this.",5
  An unnecessary live action movie based on a brilliant anime which does live anywhere up to its expectations.as a movie on it's own? very boring with very forgettable characters.,1
  Some good visuals cant help the absence of any plot (why exacly did the bad guy kidnap those kids..(ie could he not have found willing followers or people who wanted the process)\?)....plus am I the only one that thinks Scarlett Johansson's acting is mostly just reading in a boring voice?,2
"  Amazing movie, I really enjoyed this movie. He mix of Japanese and American culture worked really well.",5
"  The story is different from the anime but the scent of GitS is the same, I loved it <3",5
  A relatively meh film which tries to turn anime into an actually good movie. A step up from the AoT live action disaster which probably is the reason why I don't trust the Tokyo Ghoul live action film. With relatively good acting the film decideds to f@$& together a story which is escelated to quickly and infollowable. Overall this movie wasn't worth time or money. Even the most accepting person will think my spelling is utter cra$ and the most hard core anime fan will be disappointed with this movie.,2
"  It wasn't a bad movie; it just wasn't all that engaging. I don't know who came up with these ideas first, but I saw so many other movies in this story: Matrix, Inception, self/less, Robocop, Minority Report, and Skyfall. And that's why this movie was so bleh to me-- been there, saw that. Perhaps it was fresh when the original was made, but it's not fresh anymore. Plus, the whole language thing was distracting. Her bosses spoke to her in Japanese, but she spoke in English. I guess that's because the scientist who created her was European? But her brain is still Japanese, so it still doesn't jive. They were trying too hard to keep both cultures-- the culture of the source material and the culture of the cinematic audience. Why not just put the whole story in an American city? I can see why people had issues with it. The boycott was so successful that I couldn't even go watch the movie after a few weeks. It was gone. I had to wait until it came to on-demand.",2
  I have no idea. Actually forgot I watched it after 5 minutes. The movie wasn't bad. One time watch.,2
"  Ghost in the Shell: This live action remake of the 1996 Japanese animé (itself based on a very popular Japanese manga), stars Scarlett Johansson as a futuristic, first-of-her-kind, crime fighting human/robot hybrid, who ends up battling her creators after uncovering the awful secret about how she came to be. While the visual effects are truly impressive, that is all this film has going for it. Both the Jason Bourne knockoff story and Johansson's performance are bland, tedious and lifeless. D+",1
"  Very enjoyable show. Lots to see, worth watching.",4
  visuals are stunning and even though i have watched the original many times I will watch this again as I love ghost in the shell and Scarlett Johansson,4
"  Exactly as expected, sadly. All visual gloss, but no feeling or meaning behind it all. It just felt so empty. Yes, I did see the original movie, and enjoyed it a lot., It had mood, feeling, urgency. This has none of that. Scarlet is fine in the role of The Major, but she still felt out of place somehow. Like an Asian actress would have fit the role better. The guy who plays Batou was freaking perfect. I dug the ScI-fi technopunk CG world from a purely visual perspective. It makes you want to go there and be a part of it. It's too bad it's just so empty otherwise. The story was kind of weak in the original and it still is here. It's a minor blip in a much bigger potential narrative about AI and how it will affect the future of society. I hated how the scriptwriters felt the need to explain the title multiple times. Like we're stupid and don't get what it would mean otherwise. Then we have the whole name thing. Her name is NOT Major. She is A Major, but everyone keeps calling her Major with the THE attached. I cringed every time I heard it.",2
  For me this movie did not capture the magic of the original. I didn't feel anything new from this movie that I did not get from the original. The best thing for me was the score. I would take a pass on this one.,1
"  Pros:Visually stunning.Cons:Everything else. Dumbed down plot, weak (WEAK) try to link Scarlett Johansson to Japan/Japanese culture. This was a hollow remake that should have been renamed Empty Shell.",1
"  It's an ok movie, like for when you are drinking with friends and need a background noise this is the perfect movie for that.",2
"  Three words ""A freaking masterpiece"", as a fan of the anime, it does justice to the anime but at the same time stands on it's own",5
"  This movie other than the visuals was terrible. The plot was weak and there was no character development. The lack of overall emotion conveyed was terribly weak and you never felt attached to anyone because of it. This has been one of the only action movies where I was bored, even during fight sequences . It's to bad.",1
"  Fantastic scifi movie, visuals are incredible, the action is really cool, good soundtrack, good acting, good plot. No reason for these low reviews that other people have given.",5
  Totally butchered from the anime...,2
"  This film expanded slightly more in areas that the animated movies had difficulty with. This movie also kept the integrity of the classic Ghost in the shell animated movie. Kudos, and thank you!",5
"  pacing wrong, plot contrived, epic soundtrack scrapped, point of original story barely apparent, complete garbage overall but it looks nice!",1
"  An homage to the feel of the original films and anime series, the quiet and contemplative feel of the film is very much in line with what I expected. The action scenes were used sparingly and well placed to progress the story and not just to sell tickets.I was worried that by using a mainstream actress that some of the films integrity would be sacrificed to ""fan service"" this was not the case, even the 3D shot setups flowed seamlessly and did not feel clunky in 2D.The only negative I have for this film is the theology behind the ghost in the shell issue was brought up very bluntly and did not give the audience credit. In summery this film set up the anime without taking liberties, and going in without expectations it provided an excellent narrative that gracefully lacked Hollywood tropes.",4
"  It could have been a new Matrix, a modern classic, but it's just eye candy",2
  Really great performances and visuals. Entertaining and luminous.,4
  It's like Scarlett is actively seeking out that solo action film until they green light a Black Widow project.,2
"  As an 'individual' film, LOVED IT! In relation to the original .........",4
"  Whitewashing, doing what it does best.",0
  Not bad but not good either.,2
"  Ótima produção visual, pena que gastou tanto tempo nisso e pouco no caráter da narrativa",1
  With High Hopes I'd hoped that after the last failures of the last adaptations of anime to Alive action would get better. But alas unfortunately the Ghost is not. Hollywood please just give up or find somebody that has a true interest and enthusiasm to bring those wonderful shows or movies to life.,1
  Interested but I the first time I saw this preview i was surprised the movie wasn't called Scarlett's body because I that's what people who aren't fans of this anime are going to this movie for,1
  Very disappointed; I prefer the original show by far.,2
  hmmm... seems like maybe something for anime fans... Scarlett is badass.. but the story is kind of the same old robocop tale. glad i only paid 25 cents to rent that one,2
"  Style over substance, but easy enough viewing. Bare minimum plotting though.",2
"  The movie was just like the anime, only with a different name for the Major, and there was a backstory on Batou's eyes.",5
"  This movie wasn't really that good, but I like seeing Scarlett Johansson.",2
  Great action with awesome special effects. Toward the end everything is a bit too dramatic - in a very Asian way.,2
  Aesthetically pleasing however the film is lacking a spice which Hollywood almost always fails to use: variety. Big disappointment. Complete bore. In fact I have experienced more excitement in writing this review than watching half of the movie.,0
  Great visuals but I just wasn't interested in any of the story,2
"  Was interesting, great visuals, decent characters, some great.",4
  I only like the art direction.,2
"  I thought the product not only captured the essence of the original but made it more accessible. Maybe that's why it lost some charm. I will say that the ""bad"" guy Cutter was pretty one dimensional and added no flair or depth to the story, but other than that I thought it was very well executed. Johansson did a phenomenal job.",4
  brassy and ballsy it made sense. a solid $9 action movie,4
"  As a Ghost in Shell anime fan this movie truly upset me. I don't care about the ""White Washing"" but the characters were not portrayed at all like their anime counterparts... Each one of the Section 9 members including the boss man were not played well and it ruined the whole thing for me even while putting myself in the shoes of a person who has never seen the anime. Very Disappointed.",1
"  Didn't think it was as bad as some people said. It wasn't true to the original stories, but it was a well-done re-imagining.",5
"  Bad, very bad history, they had the chance to make something new, not only a live action version, but they blew it.",1
"  Who cares about the anime that came first? Not me. Never saw it. So ease up, nerds. I enjoyed this movie! Recommended!",0
"  I really enjoyed this movie. I liked the action, story, and visuals. My only issue is that I don't see a lot of rewatch ability.",4
  I thought it was a good movie. I've never heard of the source material which made the experience better I suppose.,5
"  I have no clue why Scarlett Johansson decided to be in this. The whole movies is, fittingly or unfittingly, lifeless.",2
"  Typical self sexploitation by Scarjo. Her butt is incredibly sexy in a scuba diving costume. Beat Takeshi is used as mere racial prop to appease the audience in the country where the manga was originally written. Includes a little violence and some gunshot action sequences, as well her previous efforts, Lucy and her character in the MCU. Only worth the time if you are an admirer of her body, as yours truly.",1
"  Truly amazing that they butchered this film. The film was extremely dry, the entire tone of the film had a flat monotone setting and performance by the actors. The film is littered with flaws/mistakes.The story, structure, characters, settings were laid out for decades in written, illustrated, & animated (Twice!) formats if the goal was to just do a live action format of the story. But no, they not only took that premise, they integrated that ol'manufactured, hollywood assembly line story structure with it. This completely put the story all over the place making little to no sense in terms of direction & plot. If you managed to not fall asleep & made it thru the film you will be left feeling 'MEH'... complete deadpan nothing. There was no moment of thrills, of worry, care, invested interest at all. 'MEH'",0
  An empty shell of a missed opportunity. ð???,2
"  Exceptional acting from Scarlett Johannsen. Decent plot that should have been explored more thoroughly. Great supporting cast that I wanted to learn more about. I can understand why this would work better as a series, but it had great action and a uniquely immersive world that made this movie worth watching. A definite recommendation. I wish to see more of this world.",4
"  A bit ridiculous, but action packed and entertaining enough for a watch.",2
"  While Ghost in The Shell manages to translate the japanese sci-fi aesthetic from its anime counterpart quite beautifully, everything else pale into insignificance.",1
"  A visually impressive, but ultimately boring film. Pacing is slow, the tone is somber and drab, characters are uninteresting.",2
  Great movie that has a bulky plot that somehow makes it so you don't have to hand hold non anime fans through the story.,5
"  Unfortunately, hard to watch",2
  SPOILER: A good guy is actually the bad guy. Surprise! Not really. The story is boring and slow.,1
  4 out of 10:It looks impressive but this remake of Ghost in the Shell is boring and feels like a generic cop movie.,2
  amazing but has flaws well a few flaws but I truly can't understand the hateit's amazing9 out of 10,4
  Compare it to the anime or get caught up in the white-washing stigma and you will have a problem with it. Watch it as a movie unto itself and you will really like it.,4
"  It's okay. Not a whole lot else to say about it. Despite the glaring lack of character depth, the film moves along at a steady clip. If they ever manage a sequel to this I hope the story is more engaging, and the other characters actually leave an impression.",4
"  This is a late review, and has spoilers FYI. I held off on seeing this because of the overall negative reception. I'm so glad I held off. I saw a lot of things about Whitewashing, which are apparent. That is not the problem with this movie. The problem is how much they destroyed the story, and what made GitS more than just an action movie. It was interesting. The original Anime delved into A.I. becoming conscious and growing beyond the limits man had set, and becoming something altogether new, and also touched on what Rights a being have if it believes itself to be conscious and deserving of rights. Thus the name ""Ghost (Soul) in the Shell"", just like Ghost in the Machine. This movie takes a shit on that whole business, and decides...lets remake the movie, keep the actions seens we think are cool, and make the story about putting a human brain in a shell, and so yea, you have a Ghost in the Shell. Thanks for continuing to pander to the lowest common denominator. Sure it was well done visually. But...The dialogue was atrocious, the action scenes were your typically chopped up multi cut fest, the story line was lobotomized, and the ending was just dumb. The 54% of people who liked this movie, either A: only go to movies to see pretty lights for two hours, and give no shits about having their brain engaged. or...B: Just enjoy seeing a pretty face and pretty lights, and to them that makes a good movie.  This gets 2 and half stars, because the visuals were quite nice.",2
  A hot mess of impressive visuals and bland psychobabble. And then there's the whitewashing...,2
  The funny thing is that the best parts in the movie are when it stops trying to emulate the original and becomes its own adaptation. Some scenes are copied frame by frame but are presented completeley out of context and it just doesn't work.,2
  Got pretty boringin the end that i have managed to sleep inside the cinemas.,2
  Awesome and beautiful!!,5
"  I have seen very few Japanese animated movies in my time on this small blue planet, in fact I can count on one hand how little I've seen. 'Akira' and 'Monster City' aka 'Demon City Shinjuku' are two of the only films I've seen. I have seen the original 1995 'Ghost in the Shell' movie (based on an original manga by Masamune Shirow) once, but it was so long ago I cannot remember anything about it other than some iconic imagery. So I entered into this new 2017 US adaptation pretty much as a fresh faced newbie. Could this new vision wow me?The plot: In the future humans are enhanced by augmentation with cybernetic body parts. Hanka Robotics headed by Cutter develops this augmentative technology. A female survivor of an apparent terrorist attack (Mira Killian) has her brain placed within a robotic body and is used as a special counter-terrorism operative under Section 9; where She eventually gains the rank of Major. Section 9's main target is cyber-terrorist Kuze who wants to take down Hanka. Kuze has personal reasons for his actions, Cutter has secrets the Major is unaware of. Lets talk visuals, with today's standards in special effects there is no way this could go wrong, right? Correct! the visuals in the movie are fabulous. The Japanese semi-dystopian cyberpunk world set in a not too distant future, is pretty much 'Blade Runner' tenfold, but brighter. I love the attention to detail we see in and around the faceless city as we follow the protagonists. The citizens and their individual styles, their attire, the technology they are using in their everyday lives etc...Every street or alley is bustling with life from neon advertisements to small food vendors or quirky robotics buzzing around. I liked how things just happened in the background, just routine stuff...but clearly had a lot of thought put into it. Although I think they went a tad over the top with the holograms, did they really need holographic arrows in the road?Whilst its not dark and gritty overall, once you get away from the large colourful holographic images within the gleaming skyscrapers, we find a more typical Japanese/Asian city with huge Lego-esque blocks of concrete living quarters. These areas are grey, cold and somewhat depressing to look at, but definitely not as bleak as the animated movie from what I can remember. The shift in tone from the city to the suburban areas was well handled and showcased an elaborately designed Asian metropolis. I only wish they had toned down the westernisation of the city.But that's not all, I found myself loving much more with the visuals. The car that is used by the Major (Scarlett Johansson) and Batou (Pilou Asæk) is friggin' awesome! It looked like a classic Lotus Esprit with futuristic mods including some natty alloys and an incredible neon turquoise interior. I loved the weaponry we see being used, it all looked über cool. I loved the costume designs throughout, the various robots we see such as the eerie geishas, and of course the various shots that homage the source material.Unfortunately I have to address the controversy that surrounded the movie with its casting. Fuck it! The casting was brilliant all round which I admit I found surprising. I too am slightly fed up with seeing the same actors in big movies, but gosh darn it if Johnasson didn't look perfect as the Major. Did she act the part well? Well I guess that could be argued either way, she wasn't bad put it that way. But Johansson certainly looked the part that's for sure...even up against both the 95 movie and the original manga, she was perfect. I thought Asæk looked great and did a good job with the battle-hardened Batou. Juliette Binoche added some gravitas as Dr. Quelet. And Takeshi Kitano also added much Japanese gravitas as Chief Daisuke Aramaki (although it was weird that only he spoke Japanese).What I found completely ludicrous about the controversy was the fact this story essentially focuses on artificial robotic bodies. How humans modify themselves to such an extent that they are able to insert a human brain into a completely artificial robotic body. Surely this practically erases any notion of political correctness surrounding race and gender. An artificial body can be made to look like anyone of any race or gender, with any brain inserted, a complete hodgepodge. So complaints about 'whitewashing' are completely unwarranted. The fact they had to tack on an actual explanation to appease this so called controversy was ridiculous; all because a minority of people didn't like a white female in the lead role?? A perfect example of when to simply ignore the hyperbolic outrage machine and just create your art.As a movie that I'm essentially treating as a new entry (because I can't recall too much of the original) I did find myself enjoying what I saw. Sure there were still a few quibbles that I questioned, even though some of it did feature in the original 95 movie . But at the start of the movie we see the Major leaping off the top of a skyscraper to infiltrate a section of the building in order to stop a terrorist attack. Next scene she's leaping in through the window. How did that happen exactly?? How do you go from free falling off a skyscraper to leaping through the side of the building? The sequence where Kuze (the apparent villain) programs some garbage truck drivers to kill Dr. Quelet, but where did the garbage truck drivers get their guns from? Garbage truck drivers always carry guns? A cliched double cross scenario over the eventual death of Dr. Quelet. Shooting at a gigantic steel tank with a regular gun? This clearly becomes pointless very quickly. In fact the entire plot surrounding Kuze's background and eventual team up with the Major is pretty darn cliched bog standard stuff (although I liked the irony of anti-augmentation protesters being used as the first test subjects for cybernetic augmentation).The plot itself seems to have been somewhat dumbed-down from what I can recall (and swatted up on). Yes I enjoyed the sequences that are directly lifted from the original source material, but at the same time I know they are mere window dressing and lack real depth. The 95 movie questioned the uneasy relationship between humanity and an ever advancing man-made technology. It was cold, bleak and included body horror. Dare I say identity politics (self-identity) also featured strongly, gender, sexuality and feminism.This Major is still feminine and at the same time clearly not female, we can see that, but that seems to be as far as it goes. Heck this movie doesn't even really touch on the problems with cybernetic augmentation. We are basically shown that it works wonders and can give humans a new lease of life (Batou and his eyes for instance). But at the same time there has been great cost to reach that point in technological advancement. Bottom line, sure shitty things happened in the past, but the technology is still sweet so no biggie. You don't really get the impression that there is a negative side to cybernetic augmentation here, there's no real clash of ethics. This new movie does away with much of that, presumably out of fear that the general cinema going audience either won't understand or simply won't like the heavy themes. This new vision barely touches on some of these elements and unfortunately seems more concerned with simply looking pretty. I can't deny that the movie really lacks emotional punch, I really felt that the ending should have been much more dramatic and emotional. Didn't get that, instead it just felt like any other jacked-up superhero-esque finale we see these days. So yes this adaptation has been somewhat neutered, there's no hiding from that sad fact. But superb cinematography, production design and solid performances do help in easing the pain. I still found myself enjoying the movie. If you enjoy science fiction I heartily recommend giving it a chance.",4
"  Awesome movie, loved it, almost like the anime, some part was familiar, as others were kinda like what's going on, but still awesome movie loved it loved the anime check them both out, enjoy peeps peace out",5
"  Much better than expected, better storyline than orignal anime.",4
  this film was the equivalent of getting an abortion in Nicaragua,0
"  After all the controversy this film created casting Scarlett Johansson, I thought it might at least have a story worth being bugged about. Ghost In The Shell lacks a sensible plot so anything that comes afterwards is worthless really. Casting anybody in the leading role of Major would've lead up to the same outcome: the film is nothing more than overbearing CGI and meaningless action sequences. I wasn't familiar with anime but it sure felt like this nonsense seemed to go on forever and I hated every minute of it.",1
"  Masamune Shirow, Weta Workshop. and the CGI studios get 4/5 stars for this movies end result.The negative one star is for the whitewashing, boring casting and generally knowing this was going to cause everyone annoyance who is true to the love of the genre breaking and simply masterpiece source material. <3If I could strip this movie/studio/director of the former three amazing collaborators from this movie I would give it half a star.Rep +1 NZ.",4
  Knowing the storey line of the orginal anime i thought this was a great take on GS.,5
  I very rarely go the cinemas to see a new movie and normal I enjoy it due to the atmosphere and what not. But ghost in the Shell was one of the if nit the worst films I have ever paid to see it was truly bland the over use if the same boring colour and terrible acting made me feel uncomfortable and the disrespect to the animu... how dare you disrespect anime on my time line and think you'll get a away with it you motherfuckers,0
"  If someone found the original animated movie boring, then you should definitely not touch this one - it's a simplified version with mediocre action and acting. And the CG is not that great either, it's just the design of certain sceneries/scenes that can catch your eye, rather than their level of quality.",2
"  I haven't read the ""classic source material"" for this film, so that fact did not shape my opinion here. Therefore I found this movie to be utterly fascinating in this beautifully presented science-fi flick with marvelous special effects that I wish I'd seen on the big screen in 3D. ScarJo does a nice job here.",4
"  Great story, awesome action, and the visuals are incredible! Only problem is that it's too short and I want more!!",5
"  4 stars for visuals, fragmented script",4
"  Slammed on its release and a failure at the box office pretty much everywhere it was shown, Ghost In The Shell has its fair share of ups and downs. I'm not very familiar with the original anime, besides knowing a character name or 2 and a little about its overall premise, so I can't make any kind of meaningful comparisons. I simply judged it on what happened between the opening and ending credits. It has a fantastic aesthetic, some top-notch CGI and has a very futuristic, Big Brotheresque atmosphere. Unfortunately, the story is dull and derivative, most of the characters are forgettable and the central message is copied almost verbatim from Total Recall, a far more enjoyable Sci-fi film incidentally. Despite how good things looks and how exciting some of the actions scenes could be I was never able to shake the feeling that I was watching a Matrix clone. The grim, dystopian concept, the ruminations on life and technology, plugging in and entering dreams/experiencing visions. It's not wholly unimaginative, but never displays enough uniqueness or originality to distinguish it in any way. And to address the whitewashing issue, Scarlett Johansson, who I really like as an actress, was clearly cast from her marketability and desire to appeal to Western audiences, because we're apparently all too ignorant to watch and enjoy a movie with an Asian lead in an Asia-based story. The fact that Major possibly not Kusanagi is surrounded by Japanese people and that we discover she was a Japanese child makes it all the more ridiculous. It was a pretty enjoyable sit, and I certainly didn't hate it, but what really stings is that it could have, and should have been, much, much better.",2
"  In many ways it reminded me a lot of James Cameron's Avatar. Visually it is spectacular and immersive thanks to very impressive special effects. However, the story is something we've already seen in other films (Blade Runner, in this case). I don't think this movie will be remembered as a great revolution in this genre, just as an entertaining movie. If they make a GITS franchise, they should try to give it a turn like ""stand alone complex"" to work more on the world in which it develops. The white-washing did not bother me despite what I feared.",2
"  supongo que habrá que ser fan del anime para apreciar la película, a mi me aburrió, no la terminé de ver, no crea empatía alguna.",1
  This film has no chemistry.,1
"  I'm not an anime geek, so therefore I really enjoyed it, I didn't waste any time comparing it to the annimaded version. In fact if it had been animated I wouldn't have been interested. I enjoyed the effects and the visuals alone with the storyline - another element I hadn't previously encountered. Very often if you want the original then watch the original, but if you are happy to view this in its own right then you should let be it. I thouroughly enjoyed it.",5
"  Everything this movie could get wrong, it did. It literally stripped everything that was interesting from the original. A masterclass in fucking up an adaptation.",0
"  Surprisingly, I really enjoyed this movie. It's not as gritty or smart as the 1995 animation, but it's still a gripping Ghost in the Shell movie. There are still segments that bug me that made me feel it could've been done better, but all in all its a pretty enjoyable watch.",4
"  After all the negative comments and critical reviews, I thought I would give it a chance for myself. All I can say is that if you like Bladerunner, you will love this movie. I'm not certain that Scarlett Johansson was the best casting for this role but I thought the move as a whole was wildely imaganative and really amazingly directed. I was not famililiar with the original Anime material, so I was not hindered by what I thought the movie should be and just simply, let it be itself. I was a beautiful ride.",4
"  We have watched the original Ghost in the Shell animated movie and the sequel Innocence. We personally believe that the actors in this movie did an excellent job portraying their characters, and the negative reception of Scarlet for the role of Motoko is over exaggerated. In the storyline she is originally of Japanese decent, but her body is completely remade and altered in appearance so that she would not recognize her past self. We believe that the spin that Sanders, Herman, and Moss took on word of GItS was fresh and intriguing. It was not perfect by any means, and some of the characters were a little disappointing, but overall it was nowhere near the 45% rating that currently hangs over it on here. If you are a fan of the series and you're wondering if you should see this movie, we'd say go ahead and enjoy it. If you've never watched or read any of the other interpretations of this fandom, it's definitely a neat Sci-Fi movie to sink your teeth into. We'd say that it might be harder to follow if you haven't seen the animated original film, but some of the plot differs anyways, and they did a decent job explaining an elaborate world in just over an hour and a half.",4
  Absolutely love this film,4
"  Thought it was alright. Never saw the original to compare. Started really cool, but ended with a dud in my opinion.",2
  Not as bad as I expected.,4
"  After watching the movie, all I can think now is:""Spider Tank, Spider Tank, shoots whatever a Spider Tank does...""I mean, seriously, that's the best name they could come up with for a futuristic killing machine? What next, Squirrel Drones? Guinea Pig Grenades? Sheesh.",2
  Amazing movie it was everything I hoped it would be and more.,5
  Watch Lucy For Most Of The Key Ingredient .. different attire - Relatively Similar Recency - Only A Fair Bit Better,2
  Slow start strong finish - pay attention.,4
"  A good, thought provoking movie! Up there with Ex Machina.",5
"  A dumpster fire of a movie. They tried to take parts from the Stand Alone Complex series and the original movie and jam it into one movie in hopes that they'd somehow strike gold. They were wrong. Very very wrong. The casting director, writing department and the director for this movie should be blacklisted for the mess they've made of this. They had a golden goose of a movie on their laps. They could have made the entire movie in Japanese and it would have sold better. Heck they could have just hired an Asian actress to play the lead and kept everything else as it was but no. Once again racism and the need to appropriate other cultures ruins everything. The worst part is knowing how easily these problems could have been fixed.On the plus side though the costume department done an amazing job so I will praise their work in accurately adapting the outfits seen throughout past iterations of Ghost In The Shell.",1
"  Speaking as someone who didn't watch the Anime, this movie was fantastic! The art direction and production, is some of the best I've seen since in years. It does have slightly campy moments, much in the same sense as Tron, Terminator, Blade Runner etc., but in much in the same way, it carries them well. I highly recommend watching this movie, if nothing else, just to treat yourself to some of the best futuristic CG to this date.",5
"  The fantastic visuals ruined by half baked story line and worst still, totally re-writing the characters. This feels more like a rip off from the original 1995 movie then and adaptation. It's pretty obvious the movie producers don't understand what the anime was about...",1
  #WhiteWashing lol I didn't feel any sentimentals towards this movie due to the fact that she was white actress playing an Asian woman. it didn't make sense with her mom being Asian and such lol didn't feel the connection between them. I only gave it two because I liked the action,2
  Na 20 minuten afgezet. Wat een bagger!,0
"  Without any shadow of doubt, this live-action version of Ghost in the Shell, starring Scarlett Johansson and a great ensemble of international characters will be become a movie Cult classic. Excuse the pun...but it really does 'Stand alone...'.Of course, one simply cannot compare Rupert Sanders version, with the sweeping classic Manga dystopian epic by Mamoru Oshii.And I really am somewhat staggered by some of the totally unnecessary amounts of totally ludicrous criticism, that this new live-action film has been receiving? Especially since, I've taken the time to watch the original Manga trilogy of movies and also, the Tv series, that have made the Ghost in the Shell, garnish such a true legendary status amongst Genuine fans of the Anima genre.Trust me, what Rupert Sanders and Scarlett Johansson, and the team of CGI, Conceptual Artists, Set Designers, have all done here, is to brilliantly capture the very essence and core of the original Comic books. It is an ingenious bit of film-making.And is, the subtext, plotlines, thematic ideas are even more relevant, right now.It's beautifully shot film. The opening 30-minutes are breathtaking and visually stunning.However, it is not a Remake. And for all you true fans of the original franchise, I've just got the Blu-Ray HD version.And it's worth investing in, for the very informative extras, on how the Director, Cast and Crew, collaborated together to bring what was once considered to be a totally unfilmable concept to the screen. As for the Diversity issue....It was filmed in New Zealand and China.It features an cast of International actors from Denmark, Japan, France, America, Singapore, Turkey, Australia, Zimbabwe, England, Romania.And therefore, is a better reflection of our Transglobal World in 2017.Now then, whilst I can fully appreciate the pure and simple fact, that both the film reviews and general public are entitled to their opinions.It is still somewhat disturbing to read reviews by people that have absolutely no prior knowledge of interest in the Anime/Manga genre. Furthermore, it seems to be a trend now to want to knock and completely diss/say something negative about any Hollywood mega, Sci-Fi blockbuster.But, 99% of the people reviewing this movie are just talking pure Bull. And I strongly suspect, haven't even seen the Movie at all. But, feel the need to say something stupid.However, just to reiterate...Ghost in the Shell, is a brilliantly underrated Sci-Fi, that makes some very astute observations and relevent changes and necessary adaptations.Otherwise, this would have been a Four hour-long movie. Which would've been dull and quite frankly boring. Whereas, this live-action version is extremely fast-paced, and totally justifies the choices being made here.The Cinemaphotography, the arts,visuals and concepts, the music soundtrack, the brilliant action set-pieces...are absolutely stunning.This is a great Sci-Fi/Fantasy film. And I am really starting to think, that some folks went to see a completely different film? And have these huge expectations of what and how they feel the movie should've been made",5
  Give up the ghost. This film's awful.,4
  A little cliched and a little odd with so many western actors. But Iooks good and I like these kinds of films.,4
"  Lovely to look at, but hollow inside-wait, does that describe the main character or the movie? The whitewashing goes well beyond just the casting, and that's where the ultimate problem lies: A failure to comprehend and build upon the source material, transporting it instead from Eastern philosophical influences (death of the self, erasure of being) to the standard Western tropes of individualism and heroism. While the movie attempts to redeem itself by subverting its central controversy-ScarJo's casting isn't racist, because it's the explicit product of Capitalism, which has murdered and stolen the identity of its Asian origin! hmmm-relying on that explanation and redemption as its principle dramatic twist and cathartic reveal undercuts the whole thing. Whoops.",2
  I was willing to give it a chance - but I feel like they took out everything that made the original a great movie. there was nothing redeeming about this film.,0
"  Whitewashing aside, it has great visuals, a tale of self discovery, identity and loyalty, a female lead with a solid performance and a lot of action. Personally i did enjoy the flow and the 80s-like music that amps the sense of mystery",4
  Ghost in the Shell is movie that honours the anime source material and has great that makes look of it feel real with a stand-up performance by Scarlett Johansson as the major. the movie at times can get little convoluted but the directing is presteigne and a enjoyable watch.,4
"  Not the film i was expected, white washing is bad stuff",1
  It was awesome movie I love it very much I hope there's another one like this there going to make hope it's the 2nd movie and I'm going to buy it the movie,5
"  Um robô com alma trabalha para o governo, seu corpo fui utilizado em um experimento, porém ela descobre que não é a única e que diversas pessoas sem opção para escolher foram cobaias até que tudo desse certo.. ela vai atrás de uma dessas cobaias e descobre toda a verdade, bem como reencontra sua mãe....",4
"  The negative comments surrounding this film had been a little hard to miss but I'm happy to say it's just another bandwagon that critics lept onto. The two issues I had with this film was the director, Sanders has a lack of character focus and this second film proves this fault. The second issue was the large budget, the film needed to be lower to improve chances of profitability. The source material is classic and a hollywood remake was inevitable but this wasn't going to go well casting Scarlett in the lead, she was the right choice by the way. I honestly think this film will grow an audience once it hits Dvd, like Blade runner found its feet in the decades after the initial box office disappointment. The future sci fi is interesting but Sanders wasn't the right choice to deliver this film, just look at Snow White with Stewart, mediocre filmmaking. My various issues aside this film was good and worth checking out for the spider tank scene alone. 09-05-2017. The film just lacked a central filmmaker to give this film the edge it needed. It should of been an epic Blade runner film but it fails at most creative decisions, a great cast can't overcome a misdirected film. 06-08-2017.",4
  Amazing movie. Those who criticise don't understand the original themes that were so brilliantly represented and surprisingly not over Hollywoodised. Great CGI and wonderful performance of both Scarlett Johansson and Pilou Asbaek. The original Japanese themes remain intact as does the entire philosophical question of what is the mind and the soul.,5
  nice visually but its got arguably one of the worst scripts Ive ever seen,1
"  You get the concept of ""ghost in the shell' forced down your throat so much in the first 15 minutes that is nothing left to discover and wonder about in the film. So grotesquely poor on story, it wouldn't know subtlety if is was gnawing at it's shins.",0
  Complete butchery and departure from the original contents purpose.,0
"  It was pretty to look at but the film as a whole was hollow. It only paid lip service to scenes from the anime and manga, plus I can't really say I cared that much for the characters. It wasn't terrible and its certainly better than attempts like Dragonball Evolution and Aeon Flux, but it could have been deeper and more intricate than it ended up being. If you know nothing about Ghost in the Shell you will probably like it as the story ultimately boils down to RoboCop.",2
  Do not buy in 4k! its only 2k and you can tell. looks were dog shit and so was the storytelling. waste of 30$!,2
"  I think it was a pretty good movie, I'm not sure why it has a low rating. The only bad thing that I think it had was that beginning was kind of slow. It's not really until we find out who the real bad guy is that things start to speed up a little. The movie's visuals were also very nice, I guess in the end why it has such a low rating is because people compared it too much to the anime.",4
"  An unnecessary, carbon copied, whitewashing of a classic Anime, as well as mediocre special effects, ruined it for all the fans of the original...",2
"  Although I'm not familiar with the source material to have a legit comparison, Ghost in the shell somehow manages to be convoluted while at the same time being no where near as smart as it's trying to be .it has some impressive visuals but that alone doesn't do enough to warrant its existence .",2
"  This film took everything that was good about the original anime, threw it away, and created an explosive, Americanized version of a relatively introspective Japanese tale that lacks any redeeming value. Scarlett Johansson did what she could, but her acting talent was completely outshadowed by her physical, uhhhhh, talents, and not in a good way. The film was an exercise in reproducing an element of something else (a Hollywood pastime, and in this case about the ""cool style"" of the original) without regard for the actual source material. Hence, it neither created something new nor offered an homage to the original. It was simply a wishy-washy action flick with SOME attempt at deep thought without ever getting out of the driveway to go to the library.I watched it a second time and tried to put myself in the mindset of never having seen/read the original, and it still wound up being a waste of my time.",1
"  Boy was ScarJo the wrong person to cast a Major. Whitewashing aside, she in no way resembles high tech machinery.",1
"  good movie albeit not entirely based on the anime series some of it doesn't go along with the series path i.e. hanka industries and how she becomes the major., no reference to the unit 501 but in all good movie hopefully the sequels will be better and more in-depth",5
"  In a nutshell, this is a waste of time. Not even worth the $2.00. A bizillion CGI, but the result is a mess of a movie with nothing memorable at all.",2
  Great action movie. I do enjoy Scarlet J........,4
  Much better than i was expecting.,4
"  Let's face it, Johansson is a lot cuter than Harrison Ford, and the graphics were more impressive than Blade Runner, so why was Blade Runner so much better. I think it was the story and the telling. I knew better and I still rented this butt kicking fest, you don't substitute a good story by filling the plot with explosions, gun fire and a butt kicking female in a bodystocking. Hollywood has given up on human emotion as a major ingredient of a movie...that is why I have become a fan of indies.",2
"  The only reason I would perceive anyone giving this movie a rating probably has not the original series. They maintained the culture and Ghost in The Shell vibe without Americaninizing it. Honestly tthe only characters who were depicted as American were portrayed that way in the original series. They accurately fit to the original storyline and manga which can be difficult to do. It does represent the evolution of humanity that possibly will find ways to overcome death by the means of collective consciousnean that exists after death. I would say this movie is definitely more for the fans than an audience or critics that don't have the intellectual capacity to interpret the implications found all throughout the film itself. If you were a fan of the series, this movie is definitely an overall pleasure to see. If you didn't know what Ghost in The Shell is, take the time to discover it before watching or you risks the chance of not comprehending everything. They got the emotional aspect, Scarlet Johanson played fairly well to who Major was and Banto was also the rugged brawler/fighter from the original. It felt nostalgic and worth a sequel.",2
  Really cool alternative story for the original. Love it.,4
"  A complete bastardisation of the original's plot, but scarlet johansons performance is great and the visuals minus the cityscape holograms are stunning. I cant tell weather the intelligence of the average movie goer has diminished over the last 20 years to no longer convey something thought provoking, or the writers wanted to throw in their twist to the franchise. Seriously, what was wrong with just remaking the original?",1
  Visually stunning. Well done.,5
  It was good at the beginning.,1
"  This movie was clearly made for long-time fans of the Japanese manga and anime series. As I happen to be one such long-time fan, I enjoyed the film immensely. However, I did notice that much of the storytelling relies on viewers having at least some prior knowledge of the characters. Those watching this movie as an introduction to the miniverse of GitS are likely to walk away feeling mildly to moderately confused or disappointed. Yes, it has some amazing special effects, but almost everything pays homage to some level or another to the original material. I also feel that SJ captures the soul of her character, and despite the fact that she was shoehorned into a role ideally meant for someone of Asian descent, I feel she did what was intended, which was honor the original character as a person, rather than the shell of one's appearance or origin.",4
"  Fan of the franchise, has some moments that are just for the Anime fans, the plot is kind of weak but the movie at a hole is not as bad as I was hopping from Hollywood",4
"  Visually stunning and great performances from the colorful cast, ghost in the shell lacks the elements that made its predecessor such a cult classic and is what I would call, a CGI-fest.",2
  this movie was boring af. felt pointless with characters and a story i had no interest in,1
  Excellent performance. Story line not bad. Good Cast!,4
  O bil? pentru ?â?ele lui Scarlett ?i una pentru maestrul Beat Takeshi,2
"  It Was Okay, I Really Expected A Lot More From This Movie... I Wish It Could Be A lot Better, The Ending Was Pure Trash, But The Start Was Okay ??",2
  Holy shades of Blade Runner! As soon as I saw Scarlett Johansson as the protagonist...I knew it would be better than the reviews here suggested. Definitely top-tier Sci-Fi with a distinctively Japanese flavour.,4
  Have not a clue what is happening in this movie turned it off,0
  An impressive and exciting sci fi action movie!,5
"  Remakes are supposed to be better than the previous one otherwise why waste time and effort on it? But somehow, it is rarely the case. This movie is bad enough for me to shut it midway, not because of the neon screen but because the script is as lifeless as the main subject. It is a highly predictable and quite a childish plot. The dialogues are not engaging and while Scarlett does her best, the movie is sleep-inducing.",1
  Went in to this expecting the worst but was blow away by the attention to detail!,5
"  Meh. It just wasn't very engaging, not put together very well.",2
"  Definitely not as good as the OG anime, but i still had a blast and it looks fantastic!",4
"  I'm a big fan of the anime, and of the franchise overall (SAC, etc.). I thought this was, overall, an impressive re-imagining of the series. I loved the visuals and the world building, and I thought Johansson was great in the role. Yes, the movie does have its flaws, particularly the simplification of ideas from the anime, but that didn't make it any less enjoyable. It's just a shame that we may not get to explore more of this live action interpretation in future films.",4
"  It really reminded me of blade runner, I thought the first half was interesting then it seemed to lose itself, And I also kept thinking, 1. Why is she white? & 2. the nude body suit double is really pandering with the PG13 rating.",0
  Awesome to see a live action ghost in the shell,5
"  Very good, I truly enjoyed it. Can't wait to see the 2nd one.",4
  As a fan of the anime I don't understand why it got such bad ratings... I felt it was done really well and tied in nicely with the anime. Maybe if people saw the anime they would get it.,5
  Pretty dumb the only positives I can give it really it are the spectacular visuals and some action scenes but that's all.,2
"  In the near future, Major is the first of her kind: a human who is cyber-enhanced to be a perfect soldier devoted to stopping the world's most dangerous criminals. When terrorism reaches a new level that includes the ability to hack into people's minds and control them, Major is uniquely qualified to stop it. As she prepares to face a new enemy, Major discovers that her life was stolen instead of saved. Now, she will stop at nothing to recover her past while punishing those who did this to her.Interesting concept, but the first half of the movie was slow. Seems like it could have been edited into a shorter and more appealing movie.",2
"  A completely meaningless film that does a piss poor job of following the original content with incredibly beautiful special effects. Nothing more, nothing less.",2
  Way better than I expected,5
"  So underwhelming.Was waiting for that movie, but it was only kind of ok, nothing more.The story has been cleaned and trimmed to the bare minimum until it was PG13. There's not any actual dialogue, only 1 liners.So yeah it's pretty. That's about it.",2
"  ""Visually Compelling""",2
  LOTS OF ACTION AND A GOOD STORY LINE,4
"  The visual effects and action scenes are impressive at times, but the story tones down the existential dilemmas that the anime was known for.",2
"  First off, how many sci fi movies borrow (forget 'borrow, it is like plagiarism) from the opening scene of Blade Runner? I can only assume that the powers that be assume that young sci fi enthusiasts have not seen Blade Runner. Secondly, I do not believe the curvy nude woman in the skin tight white 'shell' is Scarlet Johansson. I think it is a body double. When she comes on camera she is dressed in heavy sweaters and a chunky vest. I was only able to watch half the movie. Check it out.",2
  Couldn't stay awake and I am a Scarlett fan usually.,1
  The greatest flaw is that it feels like a mashup of the coolest anime scenes from the various anime renditions.,2
"  Ive never seen any of the original movies. And I knew nothing about the source material but I loved this movie! Interesting characters, mind blowing locations and something so unique that the cyberpunk world really come to life. I'm really hoping for a sequel to this one. And I hope Scarlett returns to fill the shoes of Major once more. Actually, I prefer the original cast return as they all did a fantastic job.",5
"  Very interesting movie with great use of CGI. I never watched the original, but I thought that this was very well made. I look forward to watching it again.",4
"  Barely worthy of a half star. Why take out all of major characters and replace with Caucasian?! Makes little sense. Great viaually, but about it. There's always another anime series to ""live-action"". Please make progress hollywood. Better luck next time",0
"  Yet again Johansson plays another bad ass female role , yawn . And some thing should just be left alone.great anime but shell of attempt as live action.",1
"  Great vision, and visuals. Acting superb. Good enough to see st metroplex on big screen. Good enough to see at home.",4
"  Amazing visuals and sound/music, and the story isn't bad either. Scarlett does a great job too. This movie is definitely not deserving of all the hate or backlash from social justice warriors.",4
"  This is a great example of a Hollywood studio trying to copy the general aesthetic of a classic anime movie with no regard for its story, its characters, or its central message. It effectively makes this movie a hollow shell of what it could have been. Like many clever critics have pointed out, it's ironically as if there's no ""ghost"" (soul) in the shell of this movie.There are some acting problems and some really bad lines, even during the big reveal where (SPOILERS) it turns out that the Major's memories are false and that they've been made up by the doctor who made her. It's not impactful at all because none of the characters were developed properly. Besides this, you can get some great insight into why the people who made this didn't care about the source material by all the ridiculous digital effects they added in. Few of them have a rhyme or a reason, most are just blinky lights for the sake of being blinky lights. This is completely divorced from the original 1995 Ghost in the Shell, where everything was done with purpose. It's clear the Hollywood writers who tried to copy the 1995 original had very little understanding of why the original became so popular. One great example of how the writers don't know how to handle the source material is the scene with the hacked garbageman. In the original 1995 anime, they explore the hacked garbageman and his false memories, how the memories of his wife and his kids were fabricated, and how almost everything he thought he knew was a lie. It's tied into the movie's philosophic message of ""If our bodies can be fabricated, and so can our memories, what makes us human?"" In the 2017 version, they have him babble a bit before he kills himself by breaking his neck. It's so unexpected and ridiculous I nearly laughed out loud when he did it. There's no rhyme or reason to the things happening on screen, and no reason to care.",2
  Thought it was fantastic! saw it in imax 3D. Everyone slightly interested should definitely give it a shot. I feel like if it makes enough they will make a sequel!!,4
"  Is that that bad?! It is a bit slow, the story is quite predictable (big bad guy is someone you know, the most evil organization is the one created you, etc)... but the visual effect, the style, ... the story, the fight scene, all pretty smooth and make sense...Ok, well, i have to admit, if you consider western pretend to be Asian.. that is fxxking weird ... And, don't ever think this movie have more stunning elements than its origin. It won't!",4
"  I've seen all of the animated films and television shows; as such I am a big fan of the show. Going into this movie I had pretty high expecations but was ultimately let down. What disappointed me the most was Scarlett Johansson's portrayal of the Major. For example, the Major in this film comes off as too emotionally driven whereas in the animated films the Major comes across as more cool, calm, and collected. It's her portrayal of the Major that made it hard for me to really enjoy this film. That said, I do not think the film is that bad overall.",2
"  Another lacklustre transhumanism sci-fi snore fest that fails on every requisite front to respect and reach Roelfs ambitious, luminous and source-faithful cyberpunk Hong Kong styling.This razor sharp lurid dystopia ought to yield an atmosphere of intelligent discourse around our potential to simulate human behaviour and cognitive process but ultimately finds imaginative ways to pass on any such sociological reflection.The edit room cutting of Pitt's character transformation is probably 2017's greatest crime as he proves thoroughly underdeveloped and little more than an expensive plot device for Johansson's Major/Motoko, an aesthetically brilliant albeit one dimensional turnkey protagonist.Unsurprisingly, Ghost in the Shell lacks any real script nous or soul leaving Sanders desperately in need of a Ruby Rhod, or 3, and leaving him over-reliant on the handful of brilliantly choreographed set piece action sequences.Disappointing.",2
  Couldn't even get through the whole movie. ??,1
  Boring formulaic garbage. I want my money back.,2
"  Didn't find it engaging, decent visuals but you won't be blown away.",2
"  Put me straight to sleep. I must admit, these techno noir, or whatever they're called, aren't my cup of tea. Blade Runner's the only one I can think of that I like, if I do have the genre correct.",1
  Simple: THIS MOVIE WAS HORRIBLE.,0
  Kinda reminded me of Total Recall for some reason but anyways special effects was really great storyline not bad but for some reason I felt something was missing,4
"  The original animated movie was interesting because of its universe and its story. If this movie was more or less able to port the visuals (where do those holograms come from?) to the big screen, the story is totally different and was turned into yet another stupid Hollywood movie when the original story was more adult and smart.Also, the rhythm of the original movie has been lost. As well, the minimal use of musics in favor of ambiant sounds is not present in this 2017 movie that is targeted at a different audience, and I find it sad to disrespect the original material which was good on its own.While watching I got bored and was looking forward to the end. It left nothing to remember. If you haven't seen Ghost In the Shell, I'll recommend to watch the animated movie and pass on this one.",0
"  The visual effects were cool, but the dialogue felt contrived. The delivery of some of the lines was not great in most cases. I liked the idea of the story, but the execution left me wanting something different. It was trying to be a modern futurist Robocop. I didn't like how they kept referring to her as a ghost and the robotic thing a shell (when they hit you over the head with exposition it makes me angry). This movie could have been much better.",2
"  You can't really compare it to the anime version, simple because it isn't, it's ""Live Action"". Okay so the main character isn't Japanese, but Hanka Robotics was full of over paid Americans and Dr. Ouelet was a white female so hardly surprising that ""The Shell"" would be a white female even though the ghost was Japanese. The visual effect are very good and I enjoyed the movie.",4
"  Filme bem doido e fraco, so vale pelos efeitos.",1
  this movie is an empty aesthetic shell.,1
"  Una buena adaptación de las películas animadas (pudo ser mejor) pero sospecho que la baja popularidad que consiguió se debió a esto. Esta historia trata temas que no llegan a la mayoría del publico, es decir, se reduce a un publico muy especial sobre todo ""fans"" de este tipo de temas. Pero sobre todo hay que darle ánimos a este tipo de producciones puesto que de alguna manera hay que combatir los desastres estupidizantes de masas que las productoras (sobre todo aquellas viejas captadoras de publico infantil para venderle muñequitos estupidizantes) realizan.",4
  Don't let the posturing social politics of strangers fool you into thinking Scarlett Johansson wasn't right for this roll. She puts butts in theater seats for a reason and Ghost in the Shell is no different. I was a huge fan of the source material back in the day and I like how they adapted the story for this film. It's excellently casted and a rare treat for those of us who appreciate the cyberpunk elements in near-future sci-fi. For me Ghost in the Shell was a really fun movie that I definitely recommend to those who would rather enjoy movies then strut around with a stick up their rear end.,4
  How did this turn out to be such a snooze-fest? Nice visuals can't save completely boring characters and a plodding plot.,1
"  Better than the reviews. If you are a fan of the original, then you may take issue with the film. But if you are a science fiction enthusiast, this is a solid, entertaining film that is well executed visually. A nice peek into the dystopia of tomorrow. I enjoyed it.",4
"  Wrong actor hired. No match with characters.A lot of known or unknown actors would had matched perfectly in the act and the physic, but Holliwood network had another opinion.",0
"  2 star for the visuals, but the style and pacing is really slow. Fell asleep.",2
"  Ghost in the Shell wasn't everything I wanted it to be. Let's start with positives: the cinematography was spectacular, meaning that the futuristic world of Ghost In The Shell was very absorbing. Ghost In The Shell boasts a great story, though it was shown rather than told to the audience. Essential context scenes are marginalised in favour of extravagant SFX. Scarlett Johansson was compelling as Major - a character that had depth. Acting was consistently sound; some characters were underdeveloped. Ghost In The Shell's poor balancing of storytelling with cool visual effects and cinematography let the film down for me.",2
"  It will put many people to sleep rather than insight room for thought. It is a slow burner that dials down action and takes time to flesh out its main character and you feel for her life's destruction. For many people will be a robot because they may find it quite monotonous. But for others, like me, it was an extremely insightful film with visual splendor. It's a misunderstood gem that is worth the watch.",4
"  this movie took the best visual spectacle from the series and tried to captivate the over arching themes into a basic ""Americanized"" idea. sadly i feel they missed the point. they should have just not bothered ?",1
  Baffled by this films negative reviews. She was absolutely fantastic in the film.,4
"  Eyes Wide Open, Deaf Ears""Ghost in the Shell"" has live-action adaptation thanks to American feature film production and distribution studio, Paramount Pictures. The fifth oldest surviving film studio in the world secured the rights of the cyberpunk Bible with the conviction of marking the beginning of its own franchise based on oriental manga's cosmos, getting one of the best-paid actresses in front. The feature film is the second work by director Rupert Sanders, and the third Johansson's performance as the heroine, after her brilliant job in ""Lucy"" and vigorous saga Marvel's ""Avengers"". Even so the Japanese anime had already been materialized by Palme d'Or winner Mamoru Oshii on a couple of occasions and the final result is indeed admirable in every way, the first flesh and blood appearance (metaphorically speaking) of Motoko Kusanagi comes, a cyborg-human hybrid leader of an elite group of covert operations baptized as ""section 9"", she's been conceived in order to help the helpless, and although she shows up clichés of the machine with own intelligence that saves humanity from other gloomy machines and sets a chain of ethical and philosophical aftermaths on her past and future, Sanders' work, too scrupulous to the panels of the reference source, feels like a progression of skills refreshing the unproductive creative day-to-day.At a glance, everyone infers which aspect takes all the praises. Visual effects and production design carry out fully what they were proposing, arousing a thorough immersion in that futuristic city of a reality that is not too far away, which drinks respectfully from sci-fi masterpieces as Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" and Steven Spielberg's ""Minority Report"". Transferring the majority of wonders of the cyberpunk book to live action was a total insanity, considering that they should overcome two major hindrances: The first one is the difficulty that surrounds manufacture of every notion of the world on which it is based, work elaborated with mastery by artistic directors, who spent whole months handcrafting many of the elements which are seen on screen, improving their meritorious work; and the second one is to free itself from American mania about maximizing even the dullest feature, losing the basic elements of the main culture. Although the artists uproot the most notorious traditions of the Eastern country, they convince of the tempestuous empowerment of science technologies in our daily life. If a cinematographic production was to be regarded a masterpiece by the glory of its pictures, Paramount's work would obtain the award without delay; it's a delectation to be carried away by the gorgeous skill of the filmmaker: the visual section. He showed his half-baked talent regularly in his directorial debut, now he ratifies his knowledge with sinister robotic geishas, a palette of nuanced colors which represent the scintillation of social darkness, choreographed fight moves and exciting action sequences that benefit from bullet time and magic sound distortions to achieve the desired impact, technological atmosphere isn't lost even in the most futile fragment, all here fits, this conformity has power and harmony, which demands to be contemplated on the big screen.Considering that the story has the signatures of three dissonant writers, clearly, the plot, based on the comic of Masamune Shirow, was going to be saturated with a complex of different proposals and looks, with resolutions don't maintain a common term. Although screenwriters trio were very respectful by extracting the vital skeleton of the manga and the films, they palliate metaphysical burden, perhaps it wasn't decided lightly, since they had to exhibit in a flexible, congenial and seductive way a work, which is the mother for many of the existential audiovisual productions of today (""Ex Machina"" ""Her"" or ""Westworld""), in other words, what's adapt an original idea? Modernize or preserve the name of an ontological sci- fi classic? This implies that the film doesn't get the same emotional and reflective blow as 1995 movie, opting to present minimal background in the prologue, thoughtful instants where Johansson possibly broods what and/or who is and that's the whole ideological implanted environment, one more incident in which Hollywood replaces depth narrative by weapons and flagrant impressions pleasing the eye , but not to the mind, of course, a less emphatic case, but in the end, one more case, and I don't blame them, because the real guilty of that awful trend is audience, who believe that cinema is a temporary amusement, something ""entertaining"", something transitory.As one of the contemporary films with more remuneration repercussions by controversial ""whitewashing"", we can determine (again) it's completely an unfounded affirmation. Perhaps the most vehement fans want the adaptation to be coupled with their demands and fantasies, but with the American film monster in the boss role, it was to be expected that a superstar plays the leading role. In the first instance, it was Margot Robbie, who was selected for the main character, though, finally and with very good luck, Scarlett Johansson agreed to play the war lady. An interesting performance made by ""Under the Skin"" actress as Major, she's who allows the audience to follow the story, but to a certain extent, since Johansson's charming performance as a cyborg-woman doesn't get to break the chains of well-known resolutions. The capable lady gets what any Asian actress of the moment could have gotten with the role, and even much more.""Ghost in the Shell"" is wounded by nostalgia for the original movie, despite this, rating it as an independent product, is a worthy adaptation; it rebuilds some things around here, replicates identically another thing over there, however, absurdly, is another feature film that Hollywood makes fairly well. This story of origins would be the direct access to the profitable and vigorous franchise that Scarlett Johansson has been looking for and that Marvel has been unwilling to give her, but based on the grossing of the last few days, sadly, it's concluded that the American audience, one of the most fervent film consumers, has literally turned its back on it, and that isn't a good thing. The sexual burden is quietly watered down and the inherently philosophical ghost is quietly destroyed, Rupert Sanders executes a blockbuster that feels a little hollow, which concentrates on presenting magnificently to Major, establishing an enemy with moral grudges and an open ending. However, performances and technical production are high; they manage to introduce in our minds a message: the need for more ""Ghost in the Shell"". It's unlikely, but if they reconstruct the narrative flaws present in this one in an uncertain sequel, it would clearly be a masterpiece, but at the moment, at least in the visual thing, is already taking enlarge steps to it.",4
  Es un Resident Evil mejorado.,2
"  Great cinematics with an intelligent storyline and well-defined characters. While I only have a passing knowledge of the original, the film version has inspired me to go and seek out the source... a win for any film adaptation.",4
"  Much like the main character, Ghost in the Shell is missing a heart. And the lack of emotion almost makes this feel like a science fiction demo reel instead of a major motion picture. It's got some impressive visual effects, but that's about it. It's not that surprising that this movie didn't succeed at the box office.",2
"  Breath taking, this is the best sci-fi movie I ever watch. Can't believe it's underrated.",5
"  When this was first announced, I was looking forward to seeing it. I love the anime` and I am a big fan of Scarlett Johansson. She deserves a much better movie than this abomination. The thing I liked the most about the anime` was that it got you to think. The only thing I thought about watching this was how long until I walked out (answer 45 min.). Another thing about the Anime` was the stark contrast between the high tech cybernetics and the filth and clutter of Hong Kong. GITS won an international animation award for ground breaking animation. In this movie, Hong Kong is just a bad rip off of Blade Runner and Fifth Element. In my opinion, the only way this movie could have been worse is if Michael Bay had directed it.",1
"  If they had named this something else and said ""inspired by Ghost in the Shell"", it might have been ok. This is complete junk. Over exposition, a story that makes no sense, populist philosophy, cliché ridiculous development, and outright heresy to the source material. The visuals are ok, but everything sort of looks fake. You can tell the people making the choices at the top probably watched Ghost in the Shell once before making the movie, and didn't grow up fans of the material, admiring the subtlety and depth of it. And they didn't get it what made it special.The worst part is the wasted potential. This could have easily been the reboot of a franchise bigger than x-men. Instead, it 's pretty much ruins the legacy.",0
  Although a cool visual film the story (or lack thereof) was terrible.,0
"  In short this is NOT Ghost in the shell, I watch all Ghost in the shell anime and comics, this movie make me keep laughing from the beginning to the end, Not evening worth your time if you a true Ghost in the shell fans.",1
  wonderful -I was memorized,5
  Me encantó más allá de todo lo que cortaron del anime,0
  Good movie. Totally enjoyed it.,5
  I thought this movie was surprisingly good. The visuals are insane and I love the storyline. (Keep in mind I've never seen the original anime). I think Scarlet Johansson did a great job - she's always good in these types of action roles. The action is awesome and definitely entertaining. I get what the critics say though about it being ghost in the shell with no ghost - they made Major seem inhuman and only having glimpses of actual human emotion. I understand that her body isn't human but by mid-movie and definitely by the end of the movie she should've been more ghost than shell.,4
"  Minor plot holes aside, Scarlett Johansson and supporting cast carry the movies lacking points with strong visuals and great action scenes. Don't come for the in depth story, come for the action and crisp choreography and impressive visuals.",4
  1.5 - cool visuals I guess.. but wtf was this omg. probably better off as its original anime,1
  How they could to crash something perceft in the beggining???,1
  this was the most pointless movie I have ever seen. Put this way I am unable to sleep on a plane but this show put me to sleep twice.,0
"  Lovely movie with great visual effects, highly recommend",5
"  As a huge fan of the source manga,I can't endorse this visually stunning,but ultimately heart and soulless production.",1
  The live action motion picture rewrites quite a bit in order to fit a lot into one movie making it seem more like a reboot. However if you look at it as merely a Hollywood into reboot then you shouldn't be disappointed. There is a lot to like here and in the end I wasn't disappointed ... aside from the fact the lone spider tank wasn't nearly as epic as it should have been. In fact scarlets performance was amazing in that we actually see a major at the point of learning what she is and who she is and does an amazing job of it. This is the first animated movie but without the epic hacking skills yet. I hope it gets a fairer shake on blueray.,4
  What a let down. Shanghai finance.,1
  if you are going to spend all that money building a robot you could at least give it a vagina.,2
  ironic...got the body...but no soul,2
  I don't get the just of the story. And therefore I did not like it.,2
"  Story was changed a bit, but the iconic scenes and homage paid to the original.... I ain't even mad. Couldn't take my eyes off of it. 4.5",4
"  Far far better than I was expecting. It's lost a lot of it's depth and subtlety on the way to Hollywood, but was clearly made with genuine affection for the source material. Visually stunning throughout. Shame the original soundtrack didn't show up till the end titles....",4
"  This movie basically raped the source material. The visuals are stunning, and they took a lot of effort to build the world, and they really focused on the small details. Well, except for the story, characters, and dialogue. It is just horrible.",1
"  The live-action remake of ""Ghost in the Shell"" honors its original source material. The action, the slow motion, the CGI, the cinematography and the remaining visualaspect of this film is satisfactory. However, it has some bad uses of characters, some strange decisions, a cheap copy of the original score and a bad whitewashing problem.",2
"  Não é o produto singular original, tarefa quase impossível, é algo diferente e no entanto semelhante em tanta coisa ao mesmo tempo. O argumento poderia estar mais sólido mas está bom qb, o realizador esforça-se mas nota-se que noutras mãos mais competentes poderia ir mais além e ficar uma pérola como o anime. O feeling está lá. 8. (y)",4
"  It's very true to the original. And it's very deep and well-orchestrated - the music, the video sequences... It's really good. I don't trust critics anymore...",5
  I came to this movie completely unfamiliar with the source material. I absolutely loved this movie. It is so underrated. I can only explain the other bad reviews as people comparing it to the original and being disappointed. I thought the visuals were so gorgeous but the plot backed it up as well.,5
  Just odd. Just throws you in and doesn't do a good job of building the story or developing the characters.,2
"  I haven't seen the anime and now I don't even intend to. This film had somewhat of a nice concept, but I thought they took it too far.Sure I believe that enhanced humans would be a thing in the future. We are already developing artificial limbs. I also agree that the line between human and machine will blur. But I don't believe it will be possible for someone to have a full-artificial body like the Major in this film.It also had some flow and continuity issues. The screenplay gets boring and the dialogue gets repetative. There was also some controversy regarding the casting of Scarlett Johansson. I thought she was okay. She's basically playing an emotion-less cyborg and see did good. It's upto you whether you take this as a complement or criticism. I this she is an above actress and deserves better roles than this.The climax fails to amaze and falls flat. Most people might even see it coming.In the end, it's a beautiful looking but empty 'shell' of a film.",2
  This film did not need to be made. The films existence is offensive.,0
  Ghost in the shell is a very bland bizarre film. It's just like a ghost. Empty and nothing thrilling from the classic source material.,0
"  The concept is somewhat interesting. But I found the story to be just boring. Badly executed. The action sequences were quite ordinary. The only way to see this movie in a positive light is to consider the fact that it's a low budget/international partnership movie. Which helps us be a bit more indulgent. But yeah, a completely forgettable movie. I will not be watching it again. Don't bother renting this movie, not worth it",1
"  Haven't seen the anime, but the film itself was quite good.",4
  As a fan of the original anime I came into this film hoping that the film makers would capture the same wonder the animated version had for me as a teen. While the film isn't completely devoid of the intelligence and sleek story telling of it's Japanese counterpart it is missing that certain something and ultimately doesn't quite give off the same feeling. If you've never seen the original than perhaps this film might hold something for you but if you're a fan of it then it might be better if you skip the live action version.,2
"  A very good adaptation of an anime giant! The Directors have done a great job, as the most important, they stick to the original soundtrack creator the great Kenji Kawai. Maybe the greatest anime reprodtion movie.",5
  great movie! great atmosphere! great sci-fi!,4
"  This slick remake was a big surprise to me. Unnecessary? Sure. Good? You bet. The visuals, soundtrack, art design, and Johansson are all in fine form. Director Rupert Sanders nailed the technicals. Undeniably however, the 1996 Anime classic of the same name is a whole lot smarter. It's impressionistic, interpretive structure is replaced by a more blunt procedural. Once again Hollywood has turned the cerebral physical, but the result isn't negative either. It's just fairly inessential. In it's own right, ""Ghost in the Shell"" is well made, even beautiful at times with some memorable set pieces and action choreography. As a live-action companion piece to the O.G. model, it's worthy! I'd watch it again. In the shadow of it's source though, it's a tough sell.",4
"  Absolutely horrible, I watched this movie completely out of spite. And to be honest, I was rather scared of the film because the obvious white wash throughout the film. Heck, the whole movie consists of white men and woman. Which typically isn't bad until the movie is supposed to be set in Japan and overall the character was supposedly a Japanese woman. There should be much more diversity in this film, and it very much disgusts me. There's more diversity in a health stricken Granola Bar than this film. God bless!",1
"  viciously attacked in the media in the US. A thoughtful, beautiful movie; not really much of action, more characters and concepts. Gives time to contemplate, not too hard to follow but still deep ideas.",4
  Was a good twist on the original movie I have seen the movies and tv series and it was a great remake with its own unique twist.,4
  As a fan of the original animated movie and S.A.C. I can't in good conscience say this was a good movie. For starters even though I like Mrs Johansson this role should have went to an Japanese or Asian actress. Japan is where it originates from and to pay homage the lead should have been Japanese. Next they totally rewrote it. In the original most people have cyberbrains and/or cybernetic body parts or whole bodies. Section 9 was already established to fight crime in that sector of cybertronics. Honestly I wish they would have picked Ridley Scott to have done this film. He mad one of the greatest cyberpunk movies of all time and GITS was right up his alley. Better yet Hollywood should just stop trying to make adaptations to manga.,1
"  I usually love Scarlet Johansson, but she sucks in this. Should have been cast with a Japanese actress. It just feels wrong, she keeps trying to do Japanese mannerisms but she can't pull them off. Other than that it's OK but still doesn't do justice to the manga versions.",1
"  What i can say about this movie is that it represents every scene based on the original story. However, I couldn't feel exactly the same thing from Animations. It was slightly lacking of the excitement and there was a bit boredom.",2
"  S.A.C 2nd Gig and the Innocence movie mashed together, and not in a good way. Some things just need to be left alone, since there's already a selection of GITS movies already out.",2
"  So.... GHOST IN THE SHELL, 2017 edition movie...One more expensive pile of shit from Hollywood !When i see this crap, i thanks everyday Katsuhiro Otomo for not having given his approval to make an Hollywood adaptation of Akira (adaptation that Hollywood exec invested in and wanted to do so badly, that it ended up being the somewhat descent ""Chronicles"").We went from a Shakespearian questioning about human soul and existence (original manga), to (in the 2017 edition) humans are obsolete, lets to go to 100% machine.Let's trash the questioning about soul, man doesn't have one.Memories ? useless !Humans history and roots ? Why bother !Moving on.In the original manga, a 100% Ai machine is questioning itself about the fact of having a ghost (soul), its existence, where it is fitting in the grand scheme of things.What is like to have memories as humans do ?What is the place of Human evolution and cyborgs on the Tree of Life (ToL shown in the original manga and symbolically destroyed by the puppet master...meaning, cybernetic is an artifact, a rupture in the evolution as in the context of the Tree Of Life)The cyborg was just a pretense to a age old questioning about human essence.In the 2017 edition, this is totally twisted. Here a former human is now a brain transplanted in a cybernetic body (like Robocop, but as you will see further, the approach is radically different. When Robocop still defines himself as an human through is emotions and memories, here we have a character that rejects booth... And we are told down the line that this is the ultimate wet tech dream, the future of humanity, rejoice puny humans, you are obsolete).This new creature rejects having memories, doesn't want to know where she comes from, never questioned having a ghost or she is not caring at all about it (As shown in the geisha deep dive scene)So, let's keep the brain because only the brain is the answer to human existence.Bye Bye the Soul, here we talk just about the Mind (which is an intellectual construct, hence keep the brain).Bye Bye the questioning about the meaning of having a Soul (the characters don't seem to have one anyway, so...) having a conscience, roots, origins.Bye Bye memories. Here memories, that where playing an essential roles in defining human existence in the original version, are stated to be trash and useless.And when the scientist played by Juliet Binoche states to the Major ""you are what everyone will become one day"", the tanshumanist scum / ultra materialistic agenda is clearly stated in all its glory.The basic premises of the 2017 version are in total opposition with the initial vision of Masamune Shirow (who was paid enough not to care, but i come back on that later on, not everybody have the integrity (nor the career) of Akira creator Katsuhiro Otomo).And the movie is a downright perverted transhumanist propaganda (that the original version, in despite of the appearances, was not)The director (whose name i didn't even bother to look for i must confess) have clearly no vision and purpose, and certainly forgot (if he ever knew), like the characters of his movie, that essence precedes form.It is really badly directed, and even not that appealing visually.I couldn't root for any characters (especially the main one) except maybe for Batou, who remains quite an interesting character (compared to the others...)And that it's when the characters are not down right ridiculous (Beat Takeshi character and interpretation is awefull, at least the other characters could have also talked with him in japanese instead of answering him in english, the sens of discontinuity and bad editing is reinforced here).Scarlett Joahnsoon, is never believable (but ok, i never thought that she was believable in any movies anyway...).One good thing however, she really looks like the manga version of Major Kusanagi, pretty damn close.as for the Puppet Master depiction... In the original manga he has a purpose, was the ultimate st graal of evolution for the main character.He was depicted as the quintessence of evolution, having transcended form/matier and becomes pure information, a omniscient soul that could take any forms, any bodies.In 2017, he is reduced to a pathetic cyborg with a human brain, that only sick revenge through the last human emotion he is able to feel and express...So basically the message is clear, humans are just like animals with no soul, just brains with a stomach, and the only possibility of evolution for them is to stay is the material world, but as a cyborg... Bye Bye transcendence...!The editing is bad, very bad. It always misses the mark anytime to bring some tensions, emotions and depth.Just when an alternative meaning could have been brought to the audience by the acting, or just the contemplating, CUT.Just a senseless succession of shoots with no interests, barely informational about the arc.A "" I wannabe a tron soundtrack"" score with no soul and emotion, that barely depicts/completes what is on screen.And i am not speaking about the fact that it is a millions years away from the multi layered original score of the manga that was mixing traditional and modern, and proposing an alternative reading to the reality presented to us on screen.It was allowing us to dive in the no verbal side of the main character's questioning about her existence and soul, adding a emotional counter part to the intellectual/conceptual talks.Now the music is just one dimensional, action oriented only, and quite annoying at times.The Director tried to insert some shoots/sequences from the original manga, but striped from their main essence, and with a ""speed"" up"" edit.When the sage points the moon, the idiot stares at the finger... It is a fail every time.Senseless, meaningless.Now what Masamune Shirow had to say about the movie...I must confess i didn't follow all the interviews he has done.But in the ones I've seen, his answer is a typical Japanese way of saying (or not saying, as Japanese do) that it sucks but hey, ""i am not going to spite in my soup..."" !When asked about the movie, the only thing he had to say (as far i can recall) was that he was very happy with the look of the city with its holographic advertising, it was what he initially wanted to do but couldn't at the time...AND THAT IS IT !As for the overall looks / designs / cgi, not even the big shock i was expecting, but that is not the most important part when the storyline is good, the acting is good, the directing is good... You get the point !",0
"  Was a really good movie. Not sure why people are giving it negative reviews... I guess if you go into the movie expecting an exact copy of the animated series then I could see how one would be disappointed. But, if you go into the movie expecting maybe some elements of the series and just a futuristic action movie then you'll enjoy the movie. I would've gave it 5 stars if the movie would have stuck with the series better. But, looking at the movie as a futuristic action movie, it was a really good movie and definitely recommend it. :)",4
"  ""I loved it's futuristic, cyberpunk world and there are some fresh ideas somewhere in here but ""Ghost in the Shell"" has such a bad computer hard drive""Movie Review: Ghost in the ShellDate Viewed: April 10 2017Directed By Rupert Sanders (Snow White and the Huntsman)Screenplay By Jamie Moss, William Wheeler and Ehren Kruger, Based on the Japanese manga created by Masamune ShirowStarring: Scarlett Johansson, Takeshi Kitano, Pilou Asbaek, Michael Pitt, Juliette Binoche, Chin Han, Peter Ferdinando, Kaori Momoi, Lasarus Ratuere.This heavily CGI-enhanced sci-fi thriller seems to show more body and visuals instead of fresh ideas. Don't get me wrong, the visual style is impressive and the movie's futuristic city is incredible to look at but there's barely a story to be presented. Scarlett Johansson is always an amazing actress, she can juggle away Marvel movies for intriguingly creative work such as ""Under the Skin"", ""Her"" and ""Lucy"" but here in ""Ghost in the Shell"", the Scarlett Johansson we all know gets stripped away for a performance that's literally robotic.The movie is based on the Japanese manga comic book of the same name from Masamune Shirow and it was turned into a great anime film in 1995. I haven't seen the animated version but it looked like it had more of a story and real substance compared to this Hollywood produced mumbo-jumbo. Directed by Rupert Sanders who previously helmed ""Snow White and the Huntsman"", ""Ghost in the Shell"" stars Johansson as Major, a cyber-mechanical body who possesses a human brain rather than an AI. Her designer, Dr. Ouelet (Juliette Binoche) calls her a miracle while the CEO of Hanka Robotics, Cutter (Peter Ferdinando) calls Major the perfect weapon.Major was originally a human female named Mira Killian, she was the sole survivor of a cyberterrorist attack which killed her parents. Major is now the leader of an anti-terrorist bureau known as Section 9 which is lead by Daisuke Aramaki (Takeshi Kitano). With the help of her friendly operatives, Batou (Pilou Asbaek) and Togusa (Chin Han), Major follows a cyber trail which leads them to a sinister antagonist whose singular mission is to wipe out the cyber technology advancements of Hanka Robotics.During her mission, Major encounters a vigilante entity named Hideo Kuze (Michael Pitt) and he explains that he was a failed Hanka test subject and that the company stole away her life. Soon, Major learns disturbing things about her past and what her employers plan to do with her next. As I said before, ""Ghost in the Shell"" is a highly stylized sci-fi film noir but here's one big problem, it's another big-budget Hollywood spectacle with routine chases and fight scenes.Scarlett Johansson does the best she can with her role as a cybernetic fighting machine who thinks and feels like a human but the majority of her dialogue sounds robotic. This performance does fall under Johansson's shoulders but she's not at fault here. The screenplay by Jamie Moss, William Wheeler and Ehren Kruger has little story or emotional value to speak of. Peter Ferdinando's performance as the villainous CEO is completely one-note and Juliette Binoche's role as Major's doctor-handler is kind of underwritten but at least she's been given more to do here than she did in ""Godzilla"".I loved it's futuristic, cyberpunk world and there are some fresh ideas somewhere in here but ""Ghost in the Shell"" has such a bad computer hard drive.",2
  Sucked not even close to the original..,1
"  Nobody will get mad at me just because i didn't see Ghost In The Shell, In fact... The original is still far better. Maybe Wait longer to see it.",0
"  While it offers some great moments, fun action sequences, and an excellent performance from Scarlett Johansson, Ghost In The Shell is a cliched, dull, and forgettable mess.",2
"  The visuals were great, the story was good. I liked it, i dnt see why everyone is butt hurt about a white girl playing a ROBOT!!!!",5
"  Besides the obvious that it should've been a Japanese actress, the movie is great. I also love Scarlet Johansen.",5
  Looks interesting enough and very beautiful. So why the heck not.,0
  Not as cutting edge as the original. But there are some nice visuals.The movie is much better than the ratings given here. It is a decent adaption and still has some of the philosophical concerns from the original.,4
"  Haven't watched it yet, but being that it's Hollywood, I expected the (justified) reviews like that of Katie Walsh here, at RT. A movie like this deserves to be produced by non-Hollywood entities who look to make film that is more than a 90-minute, PG-13 fashion show with nice graphics and set designs. Character, tension, substance are likely lacking here. Prime example why many of us never bother going to the cinemas anymore.",2
"  The Major is a woman whose brain was placed inside a completely robotic body after a terrible accident. She was placed under the guidance of Chief Aramaki of Section 9, a special police unit that deals mostly with cybernetic crimes. When Section 9 stumbles upon a man named Kuze who is murdering people involved with Hanka Robotics, they send their team after him, and the Major learns more about her past with him than she ever thought possible.First of all, I'm going to deal with the unfounded controversy in this movie: Scarlet Johansson as the Major. When I first learned of this, I thought to myself ""That's an interesting choice, but she actually does remind me of the Major-however, how are they going to justify a white woman playing a character whose name is Motoko Kusanagi?"" Then I learned that they were just going to call her ""Major"" and I was like ""Okay, so they are completely ignoring that aspect. That's either going to work for them or it's not.""I am pleased to say that in the context of this version of Ghost in the Shell, they pulled it off beautifully. This movie borrows a lot from the 1995 anime movie, but it branches out in several new directions, as well. The writers and director actually took care to acknowledge Motoko and how she was turned into the Major by being implanted in a completely cybernetic body. That made me very happy that, while it wasn't the same Motoko from the anime, she was still Motoko underneath it all and the Major as well.The rest of the cast worked just as well as Scarlet Johansson. From Pilou Asbaek as Batou to Juliette Binoche as Dr. Ouelet, everyone fit, and no one outshone anyone else. In a movie like this, the lead can sometimes feel like he or she is the focus of the movie-which he or she should be-but in this one, the rest of the cast felt like they were helping her story move along, not being dragged along for the ride. The writers got all the characters right, and it was very cool to see no one behaving oddly.This was also a brilliantly stunning movie visually. The cinematic universe the characters resided in looked so much like the universe from the anime that it made me feel like I was back in the world of Ghost in the Shell. Nothing looked fake, but it didn't exactly look real, either. It looked like a possible future world where this type of stuff could happen. Not a scene went by where I did not feel completely part of their world.The music by Lorne Balfe and Clint Mansell borrowed a lot from the anime and mixed it so well with the movie that it never detracted from the movie but seemed to help tell the story. All the right beats were there in the right spots and nothing felt out of place.In addition to the sets, the costumes for the movie were spot on perfect, from the robotic look of the Major's body when she went ""nude"" to the look of Batou's eyes. They could have chosen to keep the Major clothed the entire movie (which she was-there was no nudity), but by showing her cybernetic body, they kept the movie true to Ghost in the Shell, which enhanced it more in my view.Overall, a very brilliant movie that all Ghost in the Shell fans should be happy with. I know I was!",4
  Just never engaged me,1
"  Hollow, bland, uninspired, and feels like a rip-off of ""Robocop"" (1987).",2
  Excellent! . Similar to the anime. But scarlet is no major. Motoko's character is calmer and cooler.,5
"  maybe, not like all the people, but it is a good movie. see it without making comparisons.tal vez, no les guste a todas las personas, pero es una buena película. vean sin hacer comparaciones.",5
"  I can't even begin to understand the derision this movie has received. To be fair, I haven't seen the original film, but I found this version to be fascinating from a storytelling standpoint - impressive, given that the anime is so iconic that its plot points have become common tropes. But my god is this a feast for the eyes and ears, just as well as the brain. It boasts some of the best art design I've ever seen, no exaggeration, and for that alone is more than worth watching for people who don't mind a slightly slower pace.",4
"  Enjoyable only on a shallow level, this adaptation really doesn't prove it's need to exist (the irony) while wasting what was a compelling performance from Scar Jo. This is a typical Rupert Sanders workmanship-like visual but shallow product. Meh...",2
"  Ghost in the Shell (2017) had an enormous task. It needed to live up to the legacy of it's franchises name, as well as giving audiences a fresh take on the beloved series. What we ended up getting is an interesting amalgamation of the franchises past, as well as some new story elements not seen before. The film was advertised as an abstract revenge tale, when it is anything but that. It is a character driven story of self discovery and self actualization, much like the source material. Scarlett Johansson excellently portrays the major in a way not yet seen in the series. This interpretation is more approachable than in the 95' film which some will either like or hate. She is more relatable in her lonely struggle and has a more satisfying arc. Her supporting cast is also top notch. Pilou Asbæk as ""Batou"" and Michael Pitts ""Kuze"" are highlights. Takeshi Kitano as ""Aramaki"" is also a complete badass. The direction is excellent. Rupert Sanders takes many of the best aspects of the multiple adaptations and streamlines them into the film. Most notably the ""Stand Alone Complex"" anime. Sanders masterfully recreates iconic scenes from the original film that carry weight and narrative purpose. They also are shot beautifully. The spectacle and visuals are undeniably gorgeous. Similar to Blade Runner but much cleaner. The score by Clint Mansell and Lorne Balfe is very well done and sets a perfect cyberpunk atmosphere. Ghost in the Shell (2017) is a well acted and directed cyberpunk psychological thriller with real heart and gorgeous visuals. It pays homage to it's predecessors while breaking new storytelling grounds.",4
  This live-action remake of the anime classic Ghost in the Shell nails the visuals but is majorly lacking in the story department.,2
  Worse movie I've watched in my life that made walk away from the movie theater. My score 25/100,1
  Would have struggled to sit through it without Scarlett perhaps..,2
  Horrible movie. Bad acting and no character development.,1
  As a fan of the original anime I think they did an excellent job sticking to the storyline covering all the bases in the time allotted that they could. Love the effects love the scenery love the augmented world.,5
  Exciting film if you have never watched the original or don't have an interest in Anime. The film does a good job at re-enacting some scenes from the original but overall a very western interpretation of the original. I felt Japanese was just thrown into the film to remind us it was an anime.,1
  Conplete disregard for the actual story. So sad.,0
"  A few too many Hollywood tropes adorn this conceptually rich remake, but visually, sonically this film pays great homage to the original. Not sure why its scored so low.",5
"  Ok, but wont miss anything if you skip it! Ratings accurate!",2
  Both the scenography and the story are not completely satisfying but Scarlet Johansson menages to infuse the movie with a convincing performance.,4
  this is not ghost in the shell,2
"  Another bad anime-adaptation. Sad, because for once they got the visuals down to a point; the story, however, is ridiculously dumbed down, simple, and quite frankly an insult to the complex themes present in the original.Sure, it works as an action flick, the same way you can make a Schindlers List-remake would work as an action flick. It doesn't mean you should.This is basically the problem with all anime-adaptations nowadays. Lack of respect for the source material. Imagine all media treated equally, would you believe someone could succesfully remake The Godfather, The Usual Suspects, Star Wars, and the aforementioned Schindlers List? No, you wouldn't. So why do directors and producers think they can manage exactly that when it comes to anime? I wonder when they are going to slaughter Ghibli-films, making a search-for-identity film out of Ponyo, or an Avatar 3 out of Mononoke.It's a damn shame, I had my hopes up for this one, but save for a few moments where they actually recreated some iconic scenes, this movie is a condescending mess.",1
"  Perfectly simplifies an otherwise obtuse anime series into an easily digestible Hollywood movie. Sure, it'd be nice if the main actress was actually Japanese, but what're ya gonna do?",4
"  My gosh I was not expecting such an amazing film! I went to go see this last-minute because ""Life"" was sold out and it was just all around awesome. The cenimotography and performances made me feel like I was actually in the movie. Seriously! I legit forgot I was in the theatre untill it was over and the screen went black.",4
  well me and mom love this movie.,5
"  I really like it. Colorful, Action Packed, and I felt it followed the Anima!",4
"  I really liked this movie, the set and visuals are amazing and I think the actors were all great in their rolls as well.",4
"  Lot's of cool special effects but to me that was about it. The plot was understandable and kinda interesting, but the story was so long and dragged out. I was fighting to stay awake so I could finish the movie. Whatever life the flim had ended up turning into what most of the people were like robots. Animated and no energy.",2
"  I read this review and it says it all, When McDonald's tries to make Sushi .",2
"  A sad attempt that can't decide which element it wants to focus on, the story or the cheap visual effects. Either way it fails to bring the essence of the original movie about the robotesation and dehumanization of modern society. As it was made for lazy viewers.",1
"  Totally Awesome, a must see for any true Sci-Fi nerd and anyone who has played the game.This film has some amazing eye candy in the form of effects and Scarlett Johansson really does pull the part off and made it her own.Must Watch!!",5
  excellent Sci-Fi Action and Intrigue all combined together,4
"  Looks crazy & original plus ""Black Widow"" kickin ass! Love me some Scarlett Johansson ??",0
  Ghost in the shell has nothing new to offer the sci-fi genre and feels tired from the moment it starts. Scarlett johansonn gives a lifeless performance and nearly puts the Audience to sleep every time she's on screen. This movie never has any momentum or stakes and is nothing I haven't seen 100 times in other movies.,0
  Sci-fi is not my genre. However I watched it due to the film being adapted from Japanese anime. It wasn't a bad film at all. Would've been a better experience if I saw it in 3D.,4
"  Again the critics dont know what they are talking about. its not the original I get that, but the story is not the same, same concept and the plot and a lot of scenes reminiscent of the original,and very well done may i add but dont compare this then mark it down because different. I believe it of course has been changed so that a audience can follow it a tad better. And of course the obligatory Hollywood ending. Great film, great homage to the original, and an original in its own way. give it watch.",4
"  Great movie, you're all insane.",5
"  As a big fan of the anime adaptations, looking forward to this vision. I will give this a fair chance, as I believe everyone should.",0
"  Gripping, compelling and a visual spectacle 2017s "" Ghost In The Shell"" is going to live on as this generations ""Blade Runner""",5
  Cool adaptation of the original,4
"  had high hopes, the anime was so good. could write a whole explanation on why this wasn't as good as the anime but instead will simply say ""watch the anime""",2
"  GitS was playing at the cheaper theater so I saw that today... and it was... really freaking impressive. Like, top notch, and incredibly faithful to the original OVA!There was a quote from it that really just, rang true for a number of reasons as well, about the importance of individuality apart from the group. I can't seem to find it with a google search, though, so I'll have to look later once it comes out on Blu Ray.Anyway, I was expecting mediocre or something in poor taste, but it was a truly impressive, resonating film and just the most gorgeous Cyberpunk spectacle I've seen in ages.ScarJo was fantastic, and elevated by pitch-perfect filmmaking.I honestly don't think Blade Runner 2049 is going to come as close to brilliant as this movie was, but I'm still happy for double the Cyberpunk this year!A+ If there are any flaws to this film, I was too enthralled by the greatness to notice!",5
"  I was afraid I wouldn't enjoy this movie for a few reasons: I wasn't excited about Scarlett as the lead character, I wasn't thrilled to see that a Japanese Manga to live-action film would be filled with caucasian actors (an argument I could continue at a later time), and I was afraid that they would simply go with a Departed style scene for scene copying of the animated version. Sadly, I was right on all counts. Even though we know Scarlett can hold her own in action films, she was, in my opinion, not at all correct for this role...she simply didn't fit, neither emotionally or visually. Although the actors chosen to fill the other roles in the film were decent, it was just strange to see a Japanese creation not filled with Japanese actors. I don't understand why Hollywood has such a problem finding people who can successfully portray the characters intended by the original creators of various projects...but like I said, I'll go into that another time. The worst thing about this film, for me, is the fact that they pretty much just copied the Manga storyline and scenes. I basically watched a live action movie of an animated movie I've seen dozens of times in the last 22 years. If you're going to go all out with $110 million you should at least give me something new. With all THAT said, for someone who has never read the manga or watched the anime, it might be a slightly more enjoyable experience. The storyline, although simple, has a few rewarding twists. The action sequences, although standard, are done well.",2
"  The original Ghost in the Shell enraptured me into a vivid and beautiful existential crisis, one that left me pondering for months obsessively. This Hollywood rendition of the original work was beautiful in its own rite, capturing a far less nihilistic view from the human soul looking out into the world from mechanical eyes, yes. That said, i am pleased that this shadow made its way to the silver screen, forcing into the view of regular people and a whole lackluster generation of deprived movie goers the forgotten magic of this tale. I was personally exhilarated to see recreations from the original imagery captured so well... And I'll proudly revisit this retelling again and again.",4
"  Other than Scarjo, the action scenes, and the visuals, this was a boring mess.",2
  good movie... next read the comic,4
  Brilliant. Shame it wasn't as mesmerizing as the original.,5
"  Visually impeccable and with some good action scenes, but when you eliminate the philosofal questions of the source material, Ghost in the Shell is a movie without a soul and sense of entertainenment. Even with fine performances of the cast and some interesting moments, the movie never delivers. (2,5/5)",2
"  I went to watch it with low expectations but it surpassed my expectations. It was entertaining, good special effects , good actress and it was a good plot very much in tune with current situations as hackers. Go and watch it!",4
  That was absolutely really great! I absolutely loved it a lot because I remember watching anime Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex years ago and I remember the characters in the anime. You have to see this! It's a great movie!,5
"  Looks great, acting and casting was great, but the story line is dumbed down and this ruins the movie.",2
"  A generic movie with a lazily written story. Not to be confused with the original anime movie of the same name which was great. For a ordinary mindless consumer who doesn't have any true taste in movies it is fine;in fact that's the target audience,mindless. I think there are enough ""revenge"" action movies with the same story line for people to say this is stupid. Comparing the original work to this shows how money can be burnt.",0
  I changed my mind. it was great,5
"  While it's visually amazing, the movie is very dull and over complicated and it weighs the pacing down to a crawl. The whitewashed cast presents a major distraction, which doesn't help. I'd say skip it.",2
  it's OK but SJ makes it totally view worthy ð'(TM),2
"  Fantastic. True to the original anime via key sequences and motifs but not bound by it. Visually stunning, pacy and dynamic. Any concerns we had that it might not live up to the original evaporated within the first two minutes. Scarlett Johansson excels as Major Motoko Kusanagi. Thumbs up from us both!",5
  I know I wasn't supposed to love it but I accidentally did.,4
  Scarlet Johansson strikes again,4
"  After going back over the original stuff, this movie is a slap in the face to all of it. Especially in the way it steals so many scenes from the 1995 movie but strips away the context.",1
"  A ""bang bang, shoot em up"" that attempts to be deep and introspective but instead falls flat in the shallows. There isn't a lot to say about this film - and that's the problem. The source material is full of interesting questions, mostly dealing with the themes of identity and discovery. However Sander's ""Ghost in the Shell"" follows Black Widow, I mean, Major around a futuristic Hong Kong/Japan to fight a government conspiracy. It looks cool - so I hope WETA gets paid for their services. But outside of that its a forgettable movie that wont spawn the great saga it was intended to. The overall predictable and dumbed-down plot will leave you feeling like you should go watch ""Blade Runner"" instead. Scarlett's phoned in performance feels like just that and an awful score doesn't help anyone - maybe in 10 years we can give this another shot and do it right.",2
  Lots of action. Not much story.,2
"  Very underrated and overlooked movie, it's sad that the movie flopped at the box office. The story and visuals are fantastic other than a few stumbles in the 3rd act, overall this is a great movie and does not deserve the hate it gets.",4
"  Not a great film. Not a total disaster but one thing is certain... Not the film that the original Anime deserves. White washing aside (which is something that, if you know the original material inside and out like I do, is NOT a problem since the Major was never a full on Japanese character) the film makes too many bad and unnecessary changes to the anime directed by legendary director Mamoru Oshii. Too many things completely changed and not fully realized to count and too many problems to list here. Yes, I am severely disappointed. Missed opportunity but as rediculous as some of the choices, aesthetic or otherwise it is not a total loss. The film does employ imagery reminiscent of the Anime and Scarlett's performance is quite good as well as Pilou Asbaeks performance as Batou. Takashi Kitano as Aramaki was not necessary and he cannot deliver any of his lines in English so there's that. The ending was changed dramatically and does not have that emotional punch that one would expect in relation to the brutally epic Anime ending. In conclusion.... Fans will watch only to Satisfy their curiosity as I did. Everyone else is better to watch the original masterpiece.",2
"  I might even prefer this to the original; but despite the considerable strength of several constituents here (e.g. Momoi, Pitt), the most fertile ensuing opportunities - remain largely untapped.",2
"  I knew it was going to be crap, I just wanted to get the confirmation. I could sit here and write an essay on everything wrong with this movie, though any fan of the original film knew that it was a disaster from the minute the movie adaptation was announced. All I can say is that If you love the original, do not watch this.",1
  Pros: Some of the CGI is quite good.Cons: Everything else.,2
"  Not even close to as good as the original, but still not that bad. Starts really engaging and sorta fizzles out at the end.",2
  I never saw the original Manga film but this bored the shit out of me. The visuals were decent and a text book twitch of SJ. Michael Pitt goes all Stephen Hawking. Yawn.,1
  I was so bored watching this tonight. But boredom was welcomed instead of the very UN-boring state of the world.,1
  Lucy+2020+Hong Kong.,1
"  Some clever CGI work here. It's a well constructed futuristic technical world. I think the problem with the story is the motivation for finding the villain is unclear. The story doesn't really go anywhere, just a lot of eye candy.",2
"  This movie will have a ""Blade Runner"" like following only to end up a cult classic one day. The sets, and effects were beautiful, while the acting and story telling was superb. I can't wait until everyone changes their mind on this one.",4
"  A sensory delight! Allowing myself to immerse into this world and contemplate the coming reality of brain transplant was a real treat. This is a humble film, keeping the sound and visual stimulants as consistent as its realistic combat scenes(minimal bullets fired). Thank you to everyone who worked on this film. Don't worry about ""source material"" for pop movies like this, for most, this is their first exposure to GITS, as is often the case.",5
  Anime to live action attempt that falls short but interesting characters and colorful world make it a fun time,4
"  I never expected this movie to recreate the cult classic anime film, but what it lacked in a soul it more than made up for it by carving it's own tale in the franchise universe and in the other departments. The action was great, the acting good (<3 Takeshi) and the set pieces were awe inspiring. Watch this movie as if you're going to go watch a new cyber punk flick with political and corporate issues and with a dash of ""humanity"" theories and I promise you will enjoy it!",4
  Really liked it. As I did the anime. Will edit once I watch it again.,4
"  whitewashing aside, and without knowing that much about the anime, this was a fun movie, with good effects and good acting. Would have been nice to have at least seen more asian supporting actors to help the void of asian A list actors in hollywood to avoid future whitewashing.",4
  Perfect example of good concept and terrible execution.For the record I'm unfamiliar with the source material. But for its sake I hope it's not as cliche and predictable as this film.,2
"  Ghost in the Shell is a beautiful and well directed movie. The world that was created back in the original anime has been very masterfully recreated. Though the movie added some new plot points and some more aspects to certain characters, it stayed pretty close to the formula the original used. It was great to see some of the most iconic scenes from the first film remade in live action. This movie does have issues though, some of the things they added to the movie that I mentioned earlier don't work well. There were also some scenes that felt very awkward and lines that were cheesy, but overall I enjoyed this movie. So if you loved the original you will more than likely enjoy this movie.",4
"  Really enjoyed it, but I did with the anime. Not as subtle as that, but still a fun scifi romp.",5
  I think this movie is more cerebral than it appears at first.,4
  All heart with not that much brain. It was a fun time watching it with my 10 year old.,4
"  My four year old loved this movie. She sat through the entire movie. At times she was scared, others she laughed and the action sequence at the end had her out of her seat. No it's not a great movie for me, a 42 year old man, but let's be real. I'm not the intended audience. The excitement on my daughter's face is what told me to rate this movie five stars!",5
"  Funny, clean, family movie! Critics are crazy, don't miss this entertaining show, young and old got a good laugh all throughout this show. If you are looking for deep plots maybe you shouldn't be critiquing family shows. It was exactly what it portrayed itself to an unrealistic fun family flick.",5
"  It didn't make any sense at all. Did the thing just appear in there, or did he get a ride?I don't freakin get it!",0
  nocliches and stuff,2
  movie was slow to start. however it was awesome. hope they will come out with a sequel,5
  There's so many other ways this movie could have gone better. ]:(,2
  Felix has been pestering me to watch this film every weekend so it's no great surprise that he was engrossed throughout. This literally is a film about Trucks with Monsters in them (nice ones though!). I found ti watchable enough even if the central character is a bit of a twat. Steals wholesale from a lot of better movies like E.T. but not a bad Daddy/Son offering.,2
"  Has an 80s/90s movie feel. Sure, it's kinda cheesy, but in a good way.",4
"  Yes this isn't the most original story to come out in 2017. It wasn't even a big box office success when it came out, but in the long run ""Monster Trucks"" is an enjoyable flick for anyone looking for a fun adventure / comedy that doesn't have to revolve around a love story or character self identity issues. Lucas Til was a very enjoyable leading man and I thought that the cinematography was very well done. Overall this is a film I would consider owning and watching on a movie night.",4
"  Can we just make a general rule? Maybe in future let's not let literal 4-year-old children help write major motion pictures. Because that's what happened here, this film was literally made based on a pitch that was, in part, thought up by a 4-year-old. That's not even close to acceptable, neither is giving the film thought up by a 4 year old a 125 million dollar budget when the film was made back in 2014... oh, yeah, this film kinda sat on the shelf for 2 years because Paramount realised they were about to drop a massive turd of a film. this is the same company that got rid of the much cheaper Friday the 13th series because they didn't want to handle the controversies those films brought them, but those films were also cheaply made and always profitable. Monster Trucks was never going to be profitable, it was never going to be good (Again, a 4-year-old thought this film up) and it was never going to make $125,000,000.",1
"  One of the worst movies of 2017, I like magyver and he's terrible in this movie.",1

  I loved this ??.....my son even watched all of it.....so art taking and funnie all at the same time,5
"  I have always enjoyed linguistic humor, the type of comedy dependent upon a clever twisting of words requiring a degree of thought with the audience. An example is to turn a common phrase around by taking the literal meaning of the phrase. A simple headline in the sports page might read ""Pirates bury Giants."" Rather than accepting the phrase in context, picture a group of sea faring marauders pushing a huge person into a freshly dug grave. This is the technique utilized as the title of the latest in comedy horror flick, 'Monster Trucks.' The image conjugated in the minds of most people would be that of the oversized, over powered vehicles with tires over ten feet in diameter. The producers of this film took the phrase in an entirely literal sense, a monster that has taken up residence in a truck. Besides the obvious categorization of absurdist sci-fi comedy, it also qualifies as a flick somewhat better received by the target demographic than the critical community. The intended audience consisted primary of males between 15 to 25 years old, specifically with a predilection for watching movies while under the influence of some form of the psychotropic plant. Unfortunately, that subset of movie goers was insufficient for the studio to recover the estimated $125 million budget. Reportedly the international gross box office barely achieved half that amount. With such an incredible amount of material available to the typical viewer, even the pickiest collector can afford to take a little side trip to an old fashion 'B' Flick to channel our inner child. For most dedicated cinephiles our infatuation with movies began in our neighborhood theater. In that dark environment, we sat in the dark entertained by some of the cheesiest creature features imaginable. An exit terrestrial inhabiting a truck pales in comparison to some of the monsters that inhabited those movies. Giant eyeballs peering out of the dashboard were strange limbs darting out from the frame might almost be considered realistic compared to sheep gorilla suits under the arm or some and wireframe creature pushed by a long stick held by some union crewmember. A realization such as this will not make the movie any better but the correct frame of mind for a couple of hours of puerile entertainment.Terravex Oil is in the middle of a fracking operation near a lake in North Dakota. This is a common plot contrivance to establish some connection between the story and audience members by providing some relation to the real world. Fracking is a process to extract minerals and ore from the ground that is exceptionally damaging to the environment. This reference immediately frames the company in a negative light before the introduction of the first characters. Overseeing the operation are CEO Reece Tenneson (Rob Lowe) and geologist Jim Dowd (Thomas Lennon) for perching to go deeper to gain a better yield. Upon locating a pocket of subterranean water, a determination made as to whether or not to proceed. Confident that there is no possible life Tenneson issues the order to advance. A few moments later something moves quickly past the camera located at the drill bit. Within seconds chaos ensues back pressure exploding all the connect water lines. In the middle voice cries out ""something came out of the well."" Three creatures had made their way to the surface. While one high within the body of an old truck, the other two managed to escape. Tenneson hires a man named Burke (Holt McCallany), to track and apprehend the missing creatures. He is the rugged, overly confident loner that is always on call in the studio's central casting area.Ultimately to more in custody for the third manages to escape again making its way to a junkyard takes up residence in a pickup truck. A high school senior, Tripp (Lucas Till), has taken a part-time job in the junkyard as a temporary escape from the tedium of his family life. One of the benefits of the job he has access to all old car parts which is a great benefit for his hobby of rebuilding a truck. His main reason for doing this is one that is understood readily by anyone who has been a teenage boy; he wants to impress a pretty girl in his class, Meredith ((Jane Levy). He the course the creature who takes up residence in the truck Tripp discovers that the creature lives on a diet of oil is made itself at home on the truck. Tripp can establish communication with the creature establishing a relationship with it and after naming it Creech after befriending it. Tripp makes a promise to his new friend that he will do everything possible to get him back home. This plot resembles É.T' if you replace the quirky but cute alien with an amorphous blob with tentacles. Occasionally, the most unlikely entity will exude a level to cuteness conferring upon these odd extraterrestrials a sufficient appeal to permit the audience to form the necessary attachments to be concerned with its plight. This has been a standard technique in film since the thirties; give the creature a sensitive side.Since every teenage boy in this type of movie may be too shy to talk to a girl but he conveniently a mechanical genius. He can, on the fly; modify an internal combustion engine, transmission, and numerous other systems to accommodate an alien of cumbersome size leaving little room for the necessary modifications. The amount of time allocated for this unprecedented of advanced mechanical engineering. The common usage of this plot contrivance allows for overlooking this faux pasMore importantly, this created a new connotation for the term 'self-driving car.' Had this set of circumstances unfolded, in reality, I strongly suspect that vocal protests by Uber and other professional drivers would complain about illegal aliens' taking jobs from American family men. The response within the context of the narrative is not substantially different. The company behind the deep drilling, Terravex engages the particularly accurate and deadly talents of a mercenary, Burke. The project geologist, Jim Dowd, adamantly objects to hunting sentient creatures obviously of near human intelligence. In order to strengthen the tug on the heart strings of the viewers it is revealed that the other two creatures are Creech's parents,The acing of the movie is brisk, conducive with the brief attention span that apparently afflicts many growing up in this generation. Considering the targeted demographic that guided the design of the story. The requisite circumstantial tropes and character archetypes are infused on schedule moving the story line forward in a predicable fashion. One of the most commonly employed themes in this category is given another go: kids working to take down an oligarchy consisting of examples from, military, the government of the upper echelon of a corrupt corporation. Considered beyond the reach of law enforcement agencies represent every tier of authority, a bunch of teenagers assisted by unknown creatures, can topple the center of evil schemes. Several members of the cast will be familiar; foremost among them is Rob Lowe. He has an eclectic career covering a broad selection of genres. Barry Pepper, portraying the casually named Sheriff Rick representing the ineffectual formal branch of law enforcement, provides additional contrast to the effectiveness of the kids. The most important roles to fill are understandably the lead teenagers. Lucas Till did not have too much on his resume before this movie, but he did move on to the titular role in the 'MacGyver 'television reboot. The female lead was awarded to Jane Levy. Who had three seasons staring in the offbeat sit-com 'Suburgatory,' but has recently focused on horror movers as the mandatory 'survivor girl.'",2
"  The film starts in a junk yard, where high school student, Tripp, is learning to repair cars in his spare time. Much to his horror, one day he encounters a giant monster, so, understandably he locks himself in the cellar. The monster joins him rather like a mouse squeezing through a pinhole to desperate to get in your food cupboard. Tripp exits rapidly and perseveres with the idea of locking up the monster. He calls the Sherrif but you wouldn't be surprised to learn the monster has outsmarted this stunt once again. Consequently, the police accuse Tripp of time wasting....but there is an interested, more believing party from Terravex, the local oil company, Tripp realises they have an ulterior motive so he conceals the monster in his ramped up truck and befriends it. There's an endearing moment where Tripp very nearly accidentally catches the monster in the cubing machine.The film has some great animations where it appears the trucks can jump trains and climb over buildings.Tripp has a love interest, Meredith, whom he uses for her biology knowledge to try to understand more about these creatures.Will Terravex capture the monsters for their own greed and will Meredith ever get Tripp to love her as much as the monsters? It's worth checking out for the amazing monsters alone and keep your eyes on your surroundings as you never know if you might come across one.",4
  My 10 year old gives it 5 stars. It was fun. The creatures were cute.,5
  it was pretty good good graphics safe for children to watch and is funny and I think it is a good movie to engage in while watching it,5
  Totally predictable and a solid kids film.,1
"  170114 & 171012: Two eleven-year-old boys raved about this film. Their 50 year old escort not so much. Jane Levy reminded me of Lindsay Lohan and the film made me think of Disney. Monster Trucks is basically a two-hour commercial for Dodge with some pretty bad acting. In regards to the special effects, the creatures did not inspire much but their integration into the vehicles was pretty damn neat. Unfortunately, I will not likely ever seek this film out again. Correction, my son sought this film out again. He likes it, emphasis on likes, a lot.",2
"  Cute family flick tries too hard to be an action-adventure. Lucas Till is a very likable actor, but I feel he was far to old (27) to play the role of a high-school student. It would've been more appropriate if his character was more college-aged as his ""monster truck imitation"" scene felt weird to watch. Creech is adorable, though i would've loved to see him much earlier in the film. And though many of the chase scenes incorporated some classic stunts from typical Monster Truck Rallies, I would've loved to see more action from the film's namesake sport as well as real-life Monster Trucks instead of just one tiny scene were Tripp was watching a rally on TV. To piggy back on that last one, I'd also have preferred to see a lot more of the film's versions of Monster Trucks as well. Concept-wise, it falls short due to a lackluster screenplay. A family-oriented comedy that takes inspiration from an arguably very dangerous sport, yet doesn't feature said sport with any real impact on screen. Herbie: Fully Loaded successfully integrated the NASCAR racing-aspect into a comedy family film, though not as successful as the previous installments, but still memorable. And it even featured a real Monster Truck in the scene where Herbie was sent to a Demolition Derby. All in all, Monster Trucks is a solid B-Movie that got held back by a lackluster screenplay.",4
"  My husband nitpicked the entire movie, however my father in law said it was a ""great family film"". However, the only reason we were even watching this movie was due to the idiots who caused the shortage of gas in the austin area. Ps. I'm writing this instead of watching the movie.",0

  Looks like the worst movie ever to come out of the vile beast that is Hollywood. Of course I want to see it!,0
  I loved this movie!!! One of the first really good family movies since I was a child. Also who cares if the movie plot is something that will happen??? It is the movies and not real life. Reality TV has ruined the quality of the business. I loved how they made the creatures come alive by facial features alone. Though I normally think the ratings on this site are almost always way out in left field. But my son loves this movie along with me and his father. Also I don't have to worry about what is about to be seen in the next scene. Open ur imagination abit!!! This is supposed to be just that with facial features and actions giving the story life. Not just a cut a dry story line for the dumbest people to not get lost by but something that requires you to watch for the little things. I own this movie and it is one of our households favorites!!!,5
  Great kid movie and plot . Enjoyed watching it with my 7 and 9 yr olds. Pleasantly surprised to see Rob Lowe and Danny Glover in it.,4
"  Great & fun movie with heart. My wife and kids also liked it. The trucks were the highlight of the movie though, especially the race down the mountain!",5
"  ""This very juvenile and stupid movie could've been more hip and clever but as it is ""Monster Trucks"" contains cornball plot elements and visual effects that look dated""DVD Movie Review: Monster TrucksDate Viewed: April 20 2017Directed By Chris Wedge (Ice Age and Robots)Screenplay By Derek Connolly, Story By Matthew Robinson, Jonathan Aibel and Glenn BergerStarring: Lucas Till, Jane Levy, Rob Lowe, Danny Glover, Barry Pepper, Amy Ryan, Holt McCallany, Frank Whaley, Thomas Lennon and Tucker Albrizzi.What a weird blast of 60s nostalgia this was! The best thing I can say about ""Monster Trucks"" is that it's not quite as awful as you have imagined from the trailers and TV spots. I'm painfully aware that it's really dumb, I'm painfully aware that Paramount took a $115 million write-off on this and Yes! I'm also painfully aware that this movie was actually inspired by an idea from a studio executive's four-year-old son. It's not fake news people, a studio executive's four-year-old son conceived this idea and then Paramount brought it to life with the help of director Chris Wedge who previously directed the first ""Ice Age"" film and ""Robots"".As I mentioned, it's dumb and also noisy but at least there was creative effort put into it and it's more comforting to sit through than any of the ""Transformers"" sequels. ""Monster Trucks"" kind of reminded me of those cheesy Disney kiddie flicks from the 60s and early 70s, those were the days Kurt Russell dominated the teen beefcake market. ""Monster Trucks"" revolves around a high school senior named Tripp (Lucas Till), he lives in North Dakota with his mother, Cindy (Amy Ryan) and she's currently in a relationship with a local sheriff named Rick (Barry Pepper). Tripp's mother used to be married to his oil worker dad, Wade (Frank Whaley) but the two of them divorced and Tripp was sent to live with his mother.Meanwhile, a fracking accident occurs at Terravex Oil's property and a drilling rig gets destroyed. The oil workers and Terravex CEO Reece Tenneson (Rob Lowe) are shocked to discover three subterranean creatures pop out of the ground. Two of them get captured by Terravex but one of them is still on the loose which leads Reece to hire a mercenary named Burke (Holt McCallany) to capture the remaining creature and finish the job. In addition to being in school, Tripp also has a part-time job working at a local junkyard run by his paraplegic boss, Mr. Weathers (Danny Glover) but Tripp wants to have a better life than the life he has now and he's hoping to get away from his cruddy life and small town for good.One night, Tripp hears noises in the junkyard which leads to him encountering a huge sea-like creature with tentacles. Tripp later finds that the creature is not that frightening and he takes him in as his new friend. Tripp has also been building a pickup truck by using the bits and pieces of scrapped cars but when the creature takes shelter within the hood of his truck, Tripp has some pretty interesting activities he can do with his monster truck and he befriends the creature by naming it Creech.Tripp doesn't want anybody in town to know about the creature but his classmate and possible love interest, Meredith (Jane Levy, from ""Don't Breathe"") finds out about the creature. Meredith goes friendly with the creature eventually and she and Tripp want to find out where Creech came from. The two teens later find out that Terravex is holding Creech's parents captive in containment and Burke and his henchmen want Creech captured. Burke is one crazy lunatic of a mercenary because he has no sympathy for human life.If I were eight-years-old again, I would've really enjoyed this movie but I'm not one of those kids anymore. I'm 25 so it's a tough roadblock for ""Monster Trucks"" to crush through. The likeable performers give solid performances as their Disney, 70s-esque, fun and zany counterparts. Amy Ryan and Danny Glover play nice and caring townspeople but they aren't given enough screentime and despite giving her all here, Jane Levy has a nothing role as Tripp's classmate and maybe love interest. As for Lucas Till, he doesn't make for a good leading man and his performance is awkwardly stiff and completely one-note.Rob Lowe chews it up and spits it down big time here in a hammy performance as a no-good oil tycoon who carries a curious name. Reece Tenneson? Where did he get that name from? Did he get that similar name from a former ExxonMobil CEO who's now the Secretary of State? The screenplay by Derek Connolly (Jurassic World, Kong: Skull Island), Matthew Robinson (The Power Inside, Black Box), Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger (Monsters vs. Aliens, Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel and Chipwrecked, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water and Trolls) maybe by-the-numbers but it's not exactly a car wreck.This very juvenile and stupid movie could've been more hip and clever but as it is ""Monster Trucks"" contains cornball plot elements and visual effects that look dated.",2
  I loved this movie. it was a feel good family move that in the end left you thankful for what you got. It had a message about the way we treat are environment and how we need to do better. But was still an uplifting movie.,5
"  Yeah. This movie's bad. But... is it even worth me getting angry over it? It's just bland, cliche'd, and unoriginal. Not terrible, but definitely a dud.3/10",1
  We loved it!!! My 2 boys especially. The creatures were ugly but beautiful. When I watched the trailer I wasn't too excited but after renting the movie I bet it would've been better on big screen!,5
  Yep! Definitely needs a lot of work!,1
  it is a very good apps,0
  A fun family movie. Enjoyed by all.,4
  I don't know what they are talking about...I LOVED THIS MOVIE!,5
"  It's the basic Disney formula: lots o' heart, laughs and adventure. Really enjoyed this movie! It was a hoot. Made me feel like a kid again watching a great Saturday afternoon matinee. Really loved this movie! Think about giving this one a chance if you're looking for some light-hearted fantasy Hollywood fun.",5
  such a great movie love the way the monster was a lovely ending loved the way the monster would laugh.,5
  Silly fun and enjoyable for one viewing.,2
"  amazing movie, best movie ever.!!!!!!",4
"  What a low level slice of silliness. The filmmakers try hard to create a franchise, based around cute and loveable creatures that makes trucks go fast. The actors all seem like they are a little embarassed to be here. They should be.",1
  you are the best Way did you make these movie,0
"  As an adult, this movie didn't appeal to my movie-going sensibilities; however, my son thought it was hilarious and that's what mattered the most. I laughed more than a few times at the ridiculousity (a new word) and wasn't squirming to get it over with - a perfectly fine diversion with my kiddo. My son gave it 4-stars because he thought it was ""awesome"" but also thought that the monsters didn't look ""quite real enough."" Kids!",4
  really good feel factor film - quite sweet x,4
"  Monster Trucks is surprisingly not horrendously terrible. Still, it is far from being good. Lucas Till is pretty bad in the lead role. His character isn't likable. Jane Levy tries her best in her role, but the romantic interest role is forced. The CGI for the monster isn't that bad. It looks like they tried on that aspect of the film. The action is moderately engaging. It isn't terrible, except for the final act of the film. The CGI is terrible in the end. It looks like they just gave up in the end. The dialogue is pretty bad. It is laughable at times. The movie is mostly harmless. Little kids will probably like it. Overall, this isn't as terrible as the trailer made it out to be. Still, the film had bad acting, a bad script, and bad CGI. The littlest of kids can find fun in it, but the parents will just be bored. There are much better kids films out there.",2
  Ugly America. Complete garbage.,1
  This is a prime example of a film been pitched and then just making it all up as you go a long. Watchable but unless your really young it is forgettable.,2
"  So much potential in the plot, just very poorly executed. The platform in which trucks and monsters were integrated was pathetic to say the least.",2
  pretty cheesy and dragged out,2
  It was kinda cute and yes there were some places that really needed help with the script but overall... not bad.,4
"  It was bad... Chris Wedge directed Ice Age series and Robots, but his first live action movie was not great... It was really like E.T.! Music score was really like E.T. too! Monsters looked creepy and weird, so it can't be family movie! I heard budget was $150 million! Paramount and Nickelodeon got bad idea... Disappointed.",1
"  Great Family movie. If you love monster trucks and animals, this is a great movie for all ages. Found it heartwarming. There are many humorous scenes throughout this movie.",5
"  Monsters and trucks, monsters are kewl, monster trucks are definitely kewl. How could this not turn out to be awesomely kewl??So there's this fracking company fracking away North Dakota. One night they accidentally release three creatures from the subterranean caves far below the Earth's surface which in turn causes the destruction of their set up, a big news event. The company catches two of them but one escapes and finds its way to a local junkyard. Tripp (Lucas Till), the young man who works at this junkyard eventually discovers the creature and starts to slowly bond with it. Naturally of course the company is wanting to find this creature to cover up its big incident so they hire professional thugs (as you do). Meanwhile Tripp has discovered that the creature enjoys hiding itself inside the shell of his souped-up, modified pickup truck (for reasons only useful to this movie and its title). So Tripp must now avoid the hired thugs, avoid the creature being seen and try to get it back home. Oh and he's gotta save the other two creatures from within the evil fracking company too. Heavy week!I knew nothing about this movie and at first I honesty thought this was gonna be your stereotypical underdog racer story. You know what I'm talking about, Tripp is a languishing truck racer, possibly up and coming but waiting for his breakout moment. He then finds this monster which can power his truck, he enters races and gradually starts winning, slowly moving up the ranks and finally entering a championship. Eventually reaching the final, up against his arch nemesis, he comes from behind to win. He then lives happily ever after with his pet monster, or the monster goes back to its habitat leaving Tripp sad but happy with how his life has gone. Basically a [i]Herbie[/i] type rip-off is what I was expecting here.First lets look at the good, the only decent bit before the problems. The entire premise isn't particularly original for sure, its basically 'E.T.' (and every other clone ever since). A young man finds an alien type creature, befriends it and tries to save it from corporate baddies. We've seen this type of thing a gazillion times before. But the one thing I did quite like was the idea of undiscovered subterranean creatures, again its not totally original but its a fair crack isn't it. The actual design of the creature wasn't exactly something I would have gone with myself but it works well for the plot. It was probably created with some scientific research into its natural habitat which would explain its squid-like body shape and bioluminescence. So while the creature was a bit 'Disneyfied' in the face department (biggish eyes and a slightly expressive face overall), I did like the whole subterranean aspect of it. Its a shame we don't see anything of these creatures in their underwater world but I guess that adds to the intrigue...and fuel for the sequel.Right lets take a look at the various issues, the predictable stereotypes, the crowd pleasers etc...Staying with the creature for a minute, its bloody obvious from the get go the creature is in fact a younglin, a child, whilst the other two that are captured are in fact its parents. You don't pick up on it at first, but once you hear the nasty fracking company caught the other two, you just know it. This does of course lead to the inevitably gooey finale where the creature will want to save its parents with Tripp's help (before escaping back underground). The creature itself is of course quite large, simply a moist mass with tentacles. So you do have to ask yourself, how is this thing not being seen all the time? Also how is it surviving out of the water? Yes it may be able to survive outside of water but for this long?? Lets remember it does primarily live underwater so why would it be able to survive for so long out of the water? The creature also makes lots of loud noises including laughing...which seems idiotic but hey its a kids flick right. Oh and it lives on...oil? Well that could lead to a...sticky situation...aaah I'm terrible.OK so the main angle of the movie is monster trucks, pickup trucks and 4x4's...oh and monsters (even though in the movie I wouldn't say the creature is a monster, but more of a large Cephalopod. Yes I realise its also a play on words). Anyway so the hook here is, once Tripp discovers the creature, he finds that it enjoys 'living' inside his pickup truck shell. The creature is also able to somehow power the truck with some kind of energy from its tentacles...no clue. So Tripp modifies the truck so the creature can live in it (hidden away), he then proceeds to 'drive around' in the truck which is now...monster powered...get it? Ah there it is, we got there.Thing is, why does the creature wanna stay cooped up inside this rusty pickup truck? This is an underwater creature, but now it likes driving a truck with its power tentacles...eh? This also leads to so many obvious questions that mainly revolve around control. How the hell would Tripp ever be able to control this living creature that is controlling his truck? Sure we get some sequences of him getting to grips with this problem but it never really seems solid to me. During this time Tripp naturally experiences problems...massive insurance related problems I'm sure. By that I mean he wrecks many many cars including an entire car dealers line up (monster truck style), almost kills people (must have) and totally destroys the side of a woman's car whilst she's driving it. Surely any of this would alert the police no? Nah don't be stupid, no consequences in this movie bucko.I honesty don't know how many of the characters in this movie get away with half the stuff they do. The baddies run (drive) around trying to capture this creature causing all sorts of chaos along the way, while Tripp ends up breaking into the fracking company facility, illegal use of a car dealership garage (that just happened to have all the right tools for truck modification) and eventually stealing 4x4's! Not only that but he then proceeds to cut the trucks up so the other two creatures can fit in them when they break them out of the facility. Not quite sure how they knew what size truck they would need, or how to modify them correctly for the other two unseen creatures. What if they didn't fit?? But at the end of the day, to save the creature, all Tripp and co would need to do is expose the creature. In this day and age the discovery of a large new aquatic animal like that would be headline news around the world. Almost everyone would be filled with joy and stepping up to protect it and its habitat. So in my opinion simply exposing it to the media would save the creature right away.Believe it or not the finale is where this movie gets a bit too ridiculous. The goodies are trying to reach the original caves where the creatures came from, and they are trying to shake the hired thugs. This involves a long 4x4 chase between the baddies in their all black 4x4's and the goodies in their stolen modified (complete with spoilers), monster powered 4x4's (and Tripp's piece of crap looking pickup truck). This ends up going up a mountain which of course means what goes up must come down. Oh boy do they come down, they literally drive their trucks off a cliff edge...like a thousand feet up or whatever. Somehow the humans don't get smashed to pieces inside the trucks and manage to survive unscathed. The trucks also manage to hold together and not disintegrate on impact, ditto the creatures manage to survive too. I'm still not really sure how these creatures could survive this fall or prevent the trucks from being destroyed, they're not magical, they can't fly. Suspension of disbelief is generally in order here obviously, but there are certain levels, certain limits.So yes this is a case of throwing E.T. and Herbie into a blender and coming out with a somewhat generic, cookie cutter product low on original ideas. Lets be honest it was never really gonna be anything more than that even though the movies poster is pretty sweet. There is a lot more I could mention that I picked up on but its not worth it, minor continuity errors and such, the review would be too long. Although I will just mention that almost everyone in the movie appears to drive a 4x4 or pickup truck, which feels kinda like overkill on product placement to me. Overall the movie isn't as lame or schmaltzy as I thought it would be, the effects are fine, lovely location scenery and the acting is perfectly acceptable for what this is. This is one of those cases where (I think) had the movie come out in the mid to late 80's (or even early 90's) it might be looked upon now as a bit of a cult classic. Unfortunately these type of films don't really fly anymore because its all been done, but truth be told this wasn't actually too bad.",4

  My husband and younger female cousin went with me to see this. We all enjoyed it. I don't understand why some didn't care for it? Great family movie. Good for boys n girls to enjoy.,5
  kids loved it..real cute,5
  Great funny movie for the family,5
  good movie my kid 7 loved loved it,4
  What a fun movie. Far better than Lego Batman. The critics have this one completely wrong.,5
  Awesome action and adventure! Great kids movie!!,4
  Good Family movie...,4
  Such a cute movie! I don't get the low ratings.,5
  It's looks like crap had a baby said go make a movie,1
  When the head of the film company approaches his son for a film idea. Well not bad for a kids script!!!,4
  good kid family movie,5
"  This is a kids movie. Young kids, 12 and under will love it. If you keep that in mind, it's decent. If you expect anything more than that, you're making a huge mistake.",4
  It was a fun movie for kids don't overthink it,4
  very cute family oriented movie,4
  Bad concept and bad execution tarnish this hybrid family-friendly film.,0
  I want to see how Lucas Till will do without the X- man because he was a Star as Havak and I really like the actor hope he does good.,0
  It's actually really cool and super cute! Loved it!,5
  Monster Trucks was a good movie and awesome I loved it.,4
"  I was so surprised by this movie. It was ""Different"" and adorable. It was quirky, fun, funny and heartwarming. I don't understand today's Critics, they won't know a good movie if you hit them over the head with it. All the kids, I mean all the kids in the theater were clapping a cheering for the Monster Truck, It was good to see a clean cut, entertaining movie.",4

"  this movie did exactly what it is supposed to do...made me laugh-a LOT. sure, the hallmark of good sci-fi is that the science is basically believable. the science here isn't really believable, i mean, sure they could find species they don't know exist, but this type? nah that part doesn't exist. but i laughed through the whole movie and it had an all star cast of people i've loved in other things. Lucas Till (Havok from the X-men!) and Jason O'Mara (Agents of Shield!) then Rob Lowe (all those 80s movies and the West Wing) and Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon!) just to name a few. So this show won't win any oscars, but it's great for laughter. In fact, it's got a nice story of a kid bonding with an animal and learning to appreciate what he does have and a girl realizing not to judge kids she doesn't even know because she doesn't know what all they're dealing with. I appreciated the twist at the end with the step father not being a jerky loser because sometimes you find relationships that haven't been smooth are worth saving and movies that aren't going to win awards are worth seeing.",4
  story was ok acting good had a great cast it was a fun movie not boring,2
"  Not sure which movie the critics saw, but my 5yr old boy, 7yr old girl, and I loved it. It was full of adventure and had its share of humor. Definitely recommend.",5
"  'Monster Trucks' is a flat, misguided, laughable, vaguely likable film that isn't going to be appreciated anytime soon, but doesn't deserve to be venomously hated either.",2
"  No es demasiado buena, no tiene mucha logica, pero se deja ver y entretiene. A mi hijo le ha gustado bastante",2
  It's a cute little movie! I really enjoyed it. My 4 year old was a little bored because the story was so good and for him but that's why I liked it. It taught that monsters are sweet animals.,4
"  This was WAY more entertaining than I was expecting. Yes, it definitely has its problems (awful main character, wooden acting) but what it set out to do - entertain little children - it does extremely well. My kids LOVED it! I mean, c'mon - it has monsters AND trucks... combined. How could kids NOT enjoy that? (It has the guy who played Lt. Dangles from Reno 911; he gets some big laughs. Also, it has the single funniest use of the Wilhelm scream that I've ever seen. I was rolling!) This movie is a great example of critics missing the mark. It's a shame that many of them lack the empathy it takes to understand how a movie's actual target audience would view a film.",4
  when a 7 year old calls a movie stupid you know just how bad this kids movie is.,0
  I think this movie was great and any audience would enjoy it!,5
"  Monster Trucks is not awful, it's just emotionless and poorly acted.",2
"  A fun-filled adventure with a fun story. However, seems like any other Nickelodeon movie.",4
  fun feel good movie. plus I loved the creature design.,5
  ummm nonothing about this movie workedmight be good enough for pre teens with all the sillynessbut could scare anyone under the age of 6.i couldn't even tell you what the plot was about nor the car chase at the end. wait for cable. don't waste your time,2
  Nick Now Is Off My Intrests. THIS WAS GARBAGE UGH! This is so bad I hate the story! Omg this is embarashing.,1
"  Monster Trucks was interestingly loosely relevant to the Dakota Access Pipeline squabble of 2016/2017 yet whimsical enough to feel delightfully unreal. With humor, occasional romance and relationshipal sound bites that will get some to reassess how they interact with one another in their everyday pursuit of happiness Monster Trucks hits it out of the park and is even a great napping movie for the recently retired grandparents.Katherine WhiteGhostWriter Titanic (1997 Film)(& various other works)",5
  Painfully Average movie :/ why did I even watch it.Movie for kids I guess.,2
"  I went into it not expecting much based on reviews and surprisingly I found it very interesting, cheesy at times but I enjoyed it.",4
  For its purpose of greatly entertaining young kids and giving a little something to the parents the film accomplished those goals!,4
  Was a good family movie... the kids loved it and even us adults enjoyed it. A must see for the family.,4
"  Your kid will most likely be entertained by this movie, but as for yourself, it will be boring, but not really anything repulsive.",2
"  This is a great movie geared to kids. It is not perfect, but expecting nuance in a movie about trucks with monsters in them is ridiculous. This is a fun and original concept that is great for spending time with the kids. Everything you need to know is on display on the movie. There is not enough of this out there, and these types of productions need support. The conversation with my son after was more about what if than what happened (i.e. Rogue One; great movie, but I had to explain alot to him about the lore and tie-ins.) Monster Trucks may not be much more than what the title promises, but that is what makes it great. Watch the movie, eat your popcorn, and enjoy time with your kids.",4
  It was a good kids movie. Very entertaining for my 5 year old and 10 year old.,4
"  We saw this with our 9 year old twins , it had terrible reviews but they really wanted to see it so we went anyways. It was actually pretty enjoyable, and Danny Glover has a role in the film. Kids will love it. Kind of a neat story. The stepdad ends up being a good guy , we both commented that was the first movie to show stepdad as a good guy and real dad as a dipship.",5
"  It's reward season and I wanted to see Moonlight, Lion, 20th Century Woman or Fences but Kids so Monster Trucks! When I was explaining it to someone Mike reminded me ""they aren't aliens!"" Sorry Mike.",2
  That movie was awesome cannot believe how it turns out if you could give it a eight stars. I would.,5
  It encompasses everything my son loves! Such a great movie for a family without being a cartoon.,5
"  As you can see by the Name, Picture, or trailers this movie was was gonna be fucking awful and it was I don't even need to explain why you should already know why its fucking bad especially being on the shelf since 2014 and Paramount already know this movie was bad and it bombingLucas Till (he left X-Men for this shit) and Jane Levy should feel embarrassed for being I'm itOverall Grade: F-",0
  absolutely adorable! not to mention ram trucks everywhere!!,4
  This was a great imaginative feel good movie!!,5
"  This was a great movie to take the kids to see! I'm not sure why the critics crushed it, this movie contained everything that little boys love and I was riveted to the screen as well.",5
"  Screw the critics. This movie is obviously aimed to kids who love monster trucks. My kids loved it, that's the whole point of the movie - go have a good time with your kids.",5
"  A predictable story filled with cliche moments that abrupt ends. The lackluster story forgot to explain many things in the story. The CGI was either unrealistically done or is really ugly-looking. In the end, Monster Trucks was a bad movie.",1
"  The Monster Trucks movie is up against some big hitters. Animations like Moana, Sing, and Trolls are pretty popular, and I wondered if it would be hard for the partly CGI'd movie to hold it's own. I went along to the family screening at Hoyts at the Entertainment Quarter, and the place was crawling with hyped up kids who were all pumped to meet Creech on the big screen. I was there for the ride with my superstar junior reporter eight-year-old Emir Yasemin and his parents.How Will The Adults Find The Monster Trucks Movie?Let's be honest, this movie is not for us, but kids movies these days do tend to add the odd secret adult joke in there for us, just to keep it bearable and add some light relief. This is missing from the Monster Trucks movie, which was a shame. There are glaring potholes and cheesy lines abound, and it seems to have taken bits from ET, Gremlins, and The Goonies. The high school sweetheart, Meridith, looks 27 years old and the actress (Jane Levy) had real trouble focussing on Creech and looked a bit vacant at times which was distracting. Even Rob Lowe and a pleasant surprise appearance by a favourite of mine, Barry Pepper, couldn't save this one for me.How Will The Kids Find It?Well, this is where my junior reporter Emir Yasemin comes in. Here are his thoughts on the Monster Trucks movie, which are far more important than my own.@duffythewriter monster trucks reviewWhat did you think of the family screening day? Were there things to do?I have noticed one activity which was colouring in and there was free drinks and popcorn.Have you heard of Monster Trucks before seeing the movie?Yes on commercials and I wanted to see this movieWhat is Monster Trucks about?A young man discovers a creature at his workplace, they become friends. A company wants to kill the creature and the young man tries to save himWhat are the best bits?The chase and the creature in the carWhat would make Monster Trucks better?More information about Creech more action and racingWho should go and see Monster Trucks?I've told my friends to watch this movieWhat's your score?Eight out of ten.Monster Trucks is in cinemas now rated PG. A pleasant way to while away a Sunday arvo if you have a bunch of eight and under kids to entertain! Just don't expect much for the adults.",2
  #monstertrucks is not bad if you are just looking for some laughs. Typical monster comedy. (2/5Scales),2
"  this movie was way cuter than I expected, me and my group loved it!",5
  My whole family loved this movie.,5
  Our family loved it. Perfect for kids. Thought the story had a lot of originality and good message. Plot had some twists but easy for kids to understand. Our eight year old and ten year olds loved it. They laughed throughout. Family friendly and clean too.,5
  i think this might be the best movie next to the new power rangers,5
  My daughter liked it.,2
"  ""Kids will likely enjoy it, but I'm not even gonna remember this movie by the end of the month. Hell, I'm honestly having trouble remembering it right now.""",2
"  Bland leads, confused plot, haphazard direction.But, hey, the monster is cute!",2
  Okay film is funny for kids.,1
  Awesome movie. My children wife mom and step dad all enjoyed it. I can't see why it has a low rating.,5
  Horrible..My 5 yr old thought it was OK but it was difficult to sit through,1
"  What a cute movie. The theater was full, I wasn't expecting that but it was endearing, sweet, something everyone would love to be a part of, being a hero.",4
  My 7 and 5 year old said it was the greatest movie ever and they want it on DVD for me...? I had a couple chuckles but honestly felt like going to sleep through the movie. I pay for 4 tickets and when I go to see a movie I try to pay the most attention to get the most for my money but I felt I wasted my money on this one. I feel the target age is 5-10.,2
  My 7 year old boy says that this movie is now his all time favorite movie,5
"  Monster Trucks has a beautiful, elegant simplicity to it. It is a beacon of brilliance in film, and all artists and storytellers should look to it for guidance. No, I'm not kidding.Maybe it's just because a lot of dull and poorly-made movies have come out lately, but Monster Trucks blew me away by being so much better than I thought it would be. It has a sensible plot, likable and believable characters, arcs with payoff, foreshadowing, a fantastic cast, and so much more.It's convinced me that it must be harder to make a bad movie than a good one. It begins with a simple premise: what if monster trucks were actually trucks with monsters in them? Then, everything in the movie builds off of or supports that premise. It was carefully thought-out, and it has heart, and it has some seriously awesome action sequences. Everything was meticulously planned, from the tiny brick jokes to the actually important plot stuff.It sounds like sarcasm, but I would easily put Monster Trucks in my top 10 movies of all time if I knew what the other movies on that list were. For me, it beats out any of the big movies recently, like Rogue One or Passengers, and even movies I really liked, like La La Land or Hidden Figures.It's not getting the attention it deserves. Seriously, people, it has monsters, trucks, monsters in trucks, monster trucks, and monsters in monster trucks. And best of all, it makes all of that MAKE SENSE! And be funny! And even maybe make you cry a little bit at the end! What more could you possibly want?!",5
  Loved the story. For a movie written by a four year old it was surprisingly good. I would recommend it to a kid form 7-10,5
  My favorite film of all time,5
"  all the critics here are MORONS. Monster Trucks is a superior film, i touched myself the entire time i was in the theatre. Creech's performance throughout this entire film was wonderful, dare tell me that he's cgi and not a real monster and i will shank you next time i confront you in the back alley of the local krogers. not all heroes wear capes, and in the case of monster trucks, my hero wears an entire fucking truck on its body. fuck yeah, mothertruckin' monster trucks.",5
"  Other than one or funny moments, this movie was a total waste of time. I had more fun completing my tax return.",1
"  When looking at a trailer for ""Monster Trucks,"" you can easily say that it looks like any other poorly made January cash grab. However, ""Monster Trucks"" will surprise audiences by being more than that. Although the over-the-top performances and the poor production value are certainly not ideal, kids should have a fun time with ""Monster Trucks."" It isn't great, but it's mediocre enough for the target audience to get behind it.",2
  This is a thoroughly entertaining family movie. I brought my 12 year old son and we both enjoyed it equally. Ignore the cynical critic on this one. It's the kind of film that I loved as a kid because it has that good hearted center of classic story telling that is painfully missing in today's movies. Go see for yourself and enjoy the ride.,5
  if u have kids its great for them.!,5

One thing that really bothered me about the film was the first act. It wasn't slow, but the characters were so dumb that it was hard to feel for them in their situations. The camera work was also pretty questionable, but everything (for the most part) is just mediocre enough that the target audience won't seem to care.",2
  Fast & Furious+Free Willy+Mcgiver+Pokemon?? lol,2
  It was actually good! I had many laughs and 7years old kid loved it!,5
  An absolute destruction of a film. Overall Rating 5.7/10,1
  A fun original movie that all audiences will enjoy and has a few subtle political and environmental messages up its sleeve as we head into a weird time.,4
  This movie is a masterpiece! 12/10Best comedy of 2017,0
"  Me encanto,,mucha accion,,muy tierna,,mucha aventura..genial para toda la familia,,mucho mejor q en trailer..",5
"  an absurd, but fun family movie, loved it!",5
"  My son and his friend LOVED it. In fact, he exclaimed, ""That was awesome!"" on more than two occasions. I imagine he is in a better place to judge a movie made for kids than an adult critic.",5
"  The same folks that said Home Alone was 1-star, because it didn't have the depth of the Godfather are the same folks telling you this movie has no audience. This is a great film geared towards kids 12 and under that can be enjoyed by the whole family. Just went with three families - 10 of us total - and everyone enjoyed it (from age 3-60). If you have young boys, they will love it.",5
"  It was actually (shockingly) a pretty good story, even though it was a little cheesy in parts. My 8 year old loved it, my 12 year old thought it was pretty good. My wife and I were both assuming it was going to be awful. Not a must see but not as bad as the ratings here.",4
  Great Movie! Kids really enjoyed it! Don't pay attention to the nay-saying critics. It's a fun fictional movie!,4
  My 5 year old and I thought it was very entertaining. Kept his attention and mine from start to finish.,4
"  Read a lot of terrible reviews about this movie, but in a somewhat telling situation my four-almost-five-year-old boy BEGGED us to take him, so we did. Sure, Rolling Stone and the LA Times thought it was crap, but I suspect if they had been four year old boys reviewing it they would have given it four stars, as I am, on behalf of my boy. The story is cute and simple. The trucks are...monster-ish. The monster is actually pretty cute. There are no curse words or violence. No sarcasm or cynicism. Just a cute story about monsters and trucks. What more could a little kid ask for?",4
  My boys (8 & 10) and me enjoyed the movie and look forward to seeing it again.,4
  stupidly impractical!! well the previous tell you that! some very well known/great actors... not the main character. but if you want your young ones mesmerized for around an hour... pop this on and go have yourself a drink!,2
  Our whole family loved this movie! A lot of fun.,5
"  Just got done watching this movie with my family... I'm not sure I understand what the critics expect but this movie was good and wholesome. It had a good story line,no language,and had morals for a change.I would recommend this to anyone who wants a change from the vulgarity that Hollywood usually puts out.",5
"  I don't know who signed up for this piece of garbage when the idea was pitched sound some conference table, but, apparently they think.anything they throw together no matter how ridiculous, ignorant, far fetched, etc people will accept as valid entertainment.They're right.",0
"  While the story was predictible and the characters are bland. the concept is similar to films like fast and furious and how to train your dragon. But however the jokes are pretty decent. With lack of better way of saying it, i feel like it....came out at a wierd time. It is enjoyible to children and i highly recommend it but for 5-12 year olds adults and teens watch just for laughs. Its a okay movie",2
  Great movie for kids!,5
"  This was a very cute movie! My husband, 12 year old, and I really enjoyed it!",5
"  The critics are way wrong on this one, its an instant classic!",5
"  I really liked it , and my favorite Actor was awesome. If it's on DVD I want to buy it !!!!!!",5
"  This review is thru the lens of the target audience...kids. We saw this movie on opening night, and counting our 5, there were 9 people in the movie. I understand this will be a dud at the box office. However, the movie entertained our kids and everyone in the theater. It is a fun concept and a fun movie for the whole family, in a time where kids toys are made into uber violent movies they will never see (hello current DC comics genre).If you have kids that like trucks and movies with kids as the heroes, go see this movie. Screw the critics. If you like the previews, that is exactly what you are going to get with this movie.There is an ""eco message"" that is overwhelmingly overt, but your kids will not be affected by it. It is simply a fun, feel good movie.",5
  I really like the movie,5
"  I hope the SEC is planning to investigate the $115M writedown Paramount/Viacom took on this film. I think that this movie might just be an enormous scam or some kind of insurance fraud. This movie supposedly cost $125M to make. That's a lot of money. $15M more in fact than it cost Sony to make Passengers which starred Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt in a Dubai hotel floating through space. This movie stars Lucas Till as Tripp, Jane Levy as girl, and Dodge logo as a Dodge logo brought to you by Dodge. There is no way that this steaming pile cost $125M to make. That's 2 and a half times the budget of Arrival which again had to pay real actors with real name recognition. This looks like a $50M film max so I'm just curious about what they spend the other $75M on. Maybe they spent it on the rights to film on location at an actual Dodge dealership for literally 20 minutes of the movie. The movie itself was full of flat characters meandering their way through the disjointed plot. Overall it was utterly forgettable which is the absolute worst thing a movie about trucks full of octopi can possibly be.",1
  Shouldn't this be called Monster IN THE Truck?,0
"  I can't believe that the critics didn't like this movie. My boys 8 & 9 LOVED it and I thought it was funny and totally family friendly. Kid movies should be fantastical and cheesy! Our children get enough reality, and I don't think they made it to get the best Drama Oscar.",5
  my grandkids loved the movie she wants it when it comes out on DVD,4
"  Ok for kids under 10, but very weak for young kids and adults. Very slow and boring. A lot of trucks and no real truck action. Just a lot of talking and talking.",2
  The movie was Born ing and dumb and predictable,1
  Fun movie. Very enjoyable. Nothing new though. Save the environment. Beat the bad guy.,4
"  Though a creative idea that will surely get the kids excited, Monster Trucks suffers from poor characterization and strangely boring car chases.",1
"  While it has a few imaginative moments, Monster Trucks crashes and burns with a recycled story, forgettable characters, really dated CGI, and incredibly forced humor, it's a film that reeks of Diesel and low thought!",2
  Whoever came up with this movie must've been on some serious hardcore drugs.,0
  A good story about people that come together to do the right thing. My family loved it. Ignore the critics.,5
"  My grandson loved it, it's for kids. Don't get wrapped up in the plot just enjoy the action",4
"  I wasn't expecting much from this movie but I have to say as an adult I really enjoyed it. In addition, the other mom and five kids (girls and boys) I went with loved the movie. I would much rather see it again than ""Sing"" which we thought was a little boring other than the end song sequence. Monster Trucks is just over two hours long but we felt it went by really fast. The action was nonstop and held our attention the whole time. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking to fill an afternoon with the kids.",4
  people clapping at the end. bad reviews. nice kids movie,4
  Pretty bad didn't like it.,2
  Once again I love it when people give reviews without seeing a movie just to post something. We just saw the movie and the audience was full of parents with and without kids. The whole audience was laughing and cheering. Just a fun feel good movie and will see it again. Just good fun family fil for a change....no wonder critics paned it.,5
  Much better than I had anticipated. Solid storyline for the most part. Good humor.,4
  Funny and entertaining with good morals.,5
"  Was fantastic, really drew you into it...the creature was just so cute you had the love it and you were really pulling for them it was just a very cute very nice movie and this 74 year old person loved it",5
  the best film ive seen except 4 cars,5
"  Despite how dumb this movie looks, I've seen dumber movies.",2
"  Why am I not interested. Two words, rude humor. This is gonna obviously be loaded with toilet jokes. And finally, it just looks boring.",0
  A family friendly movie but if you're thinking about taking the bros out you might want to reconsider.,2
  so good you will die,0
"  I don't care that it is a terrible movie, if Rob Lowe is in it, it will be one of the best movies of the year. He is an amazing actor who can save even the worst of movies",4

"  My god was it bad. Don't go see this unless you want to cringe hard. The ""characters"" are paper thin and well what can I see this will drop your IQ points.",1
"  Monster Trucks is better than expected.Although the movie delivers some chuckles, the acting in this movie is absolute trash! All the 'Emotional' scenes aren't well handled and that is the fault of both the actors and the Director. Speaking of the director, Chris Wedge, Paramount lured him away from the studio he co-founded, Blue Sky Studios (Ice Age, Rio), to direct this film, was it a good move on Wedge's part, no, although Blue Sky's latest release Ice Age Collision Course is sitting at a 15% Rotten Tomatoes and only managed to rake in $64 Million at the Domestic Box Office, The Ice Age movies are huge hits in the foreign market, The foreign market helped Collision course be a success by making $408 Million worldwide total. Monster Trucks is expected to open with about $10.1 Million and end its run with $22 Million (Domestic), If that ends up being true Paramount Pictures will loose $115 Million! To Monster Trucks' credit they got me to fall in love with Creeth, Yes the CG used to bring Creeth to life is horribly done, his personality was the best thing about this movie, he provided humour and heart! The car chases in this film are also well done, they are thrilling and extremely fun to watch. Overall Monster Trucks is a hot mess, with horrible acting, lousy camerawork and decent humour.5/1050%""C-""Should You See It? If you want to go out and see a movie with your kids then...

"  This is a good movie for small kids who enjoy science. It gives elements of engineering, biology, chemistry, archeology, and environmental preservation. It starts off a bit slow and doesn't build the characters so well, but it had my nephew and the other kids in the theater cheering. Their happiness is what counts the most.",4

"  Spectacular acting by a stellar cast...not sure why it is rated so poorly. Aside for disIke of Woody Allen for his alleged misdeeds, this film is a perfect tragedy...well done.",5
"  Being a born and bred New Yorker, I have loved Woody Allen's movies all my life. His early movies were funny and self-deprecating, and Woody Allen was charming. I continued to watch his movies as they grew darker and less entertaining. But having watched Wonder Wheel, I've decided never to watch another Woody Allen movie again. Although the scenery and the acting was great, the story and character development left me wondering what Woody Allen's intent was. The movie had no comic relief, was not inspiring or even interesting, and was the most depressing thing I've seen in ages. Then it occurred to me that Woody Allen just seems to be processing his issues with mature women by doing films. Here's another film of a mature woman jealous of her young and beautiful step-daughter, who causes destruction for everyone involved. Kate Blanchette's character in a previous movie was similar. If Woody Allen has issues with mature women he should just journal them, instead of writing a movie and condemning the rest of us to watching it. Or change psychiatrists. The Divine Feminine is back and She no longer has patience for these caricatures. If you want to see a movie about a wicked step-mother, Disney does a much better job.",0
  It gets more interesting as the film goes on.Starts pretty boring but if u stick with it it's memorable.,2
"  Feels like a play with a lot of dialogue and character development, and not much fun though it is funny at times.",2
  I should have known better than to watch this emoted downer.,0
"  Woodrow is a consistent four-star filmmaker, but he really missed the mark with this one. Given all his recent trouble with the #metoo movement, this really doesn't look good for him; Kate Winslet's Ginny is a cold, unsympathetic, uncompromising madwoman. The most sympathetic, moral character is her abusive husband Humpty; not a good time for Allen to share these kinds of complicated character dynamics. On a visual design level, it is among his finest works, only very little character substance to fill in the gorgeously lit space. I'm not exactly sure when shit hit the fan for Allen, but it legitimately looks like he just gave up making it - all along it's building towards Ginny's arc, which we never get. Despite the empathy we sense for an aging woman's sexuality, nothing about her depiction seems very poignant. It seemed promising at first; a cross war of each other's respective children, Humpty unable to stand her son's mischief, Ginny jealous over his daughter's relationship with the young man she's been having an affair with. But Winslet's ferocity is almost too much at times. At first you want to see her have that arc, but she goes overboard when she makes a key decision later in the film. We get our emotions held up in the belief that she will have that arc, reaching across to her step-daughter with love, protecting her from the danger she's in. But as Mickey's friend says earlier, ""you're not dealing with sense, you're dealing with feelings."" That's a fact for everyone in the film, no sensibility anywhere. I guess Allen is trying to make a point with that in the 1950s, but something about it just seems too unbelievable. There is this ridiculous moment when Mickey goes to Ginny at her home, having concluded what happened to her step-daughter by an absurd estimation of facts as if he were TV's OCD detective Monk. He follows this with, ""it doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to figure out..."" I laughed, thinking, gees, it really kind of does take Holmes to figure that out!The film ends just as we're anticipating the next act, which never comes.",2
  Woody Allen is a genius and this film is one of his best. I was expecting the usual Allen comedy but became so engrossed in the lives of these ordinary people and the choices they made in their lives. Very Tennessee Williams. I really liked it.,5
"  Act One, Scene One: The introduction by the narrator. Act One, Scene Two: The Apartment. This Woody Allen film looks like a play, is played like a play, therefore, it is a play. Sometimes I couldn't tell at times, whether I was on Broadway or sitting on my living room couch. If you like Woody Allen movies, then you'll like this play. If you don't, then pass on this one.",2
"  Can't stand Woody Allen movies. If I had known, I wouldn't have watched it. Also, Kate Winslet is really whiny and annoying.",1
"  Allen, 82, has his ups and downs, and while there have been more downs than ups lately he is always worth the benefit of the doubt. But ""Wonder Wheel"" is a ride to nowhere.",2
"  Not even close to being a good movie, yet alone a good Woody Allen movie.",2
"  Good cinematography, good performances and underrated.",5
"  An unhappy housewife has an affair with a young educated lifeguard and wants to leave her husband for him. The side story features the husband's daughter who's on the run from the Sopranos. Pros- Stylish, colorful, and engaging.- Acting is all-around good. I enjoyed Belushi the most. Cons- Feels like I was teased. - There's no ending. - Why Coney Island?Final ThoughtsIt's a Woody Allen movie and it feels like one. He seems to be able to nail down period pieces pretty well. He has a knack for this sort of thing. I'm sure he chose Coney Island because he has his roots in Brooklyn, but this movie could have taken place anywhere. Coney Island itself doesn't do anything other than look pretty in the background. Remove Coney Island and you have the same story. They could be working in an amusement park in California or Chicago. This movie is like being served a small dinner in a fancy restaurant. It looks good and tastes good, but there's just not enough on the plate to keep you full, and you're still hungry for more. The visuals will stay with you more than anything else.",2
  It is an interesting story and keeps you watching but the end of the movie leaves you hanging. You can only assume what happens in the end but it is never really told.,2
"  I relate directly to every facet of this film, fantastical as it may be. All of the ""God damned noise,"" the ""whole honkytonk fairyland,"" the stress, the struggle, the crime. The experience of watching this film is personal, it's truthfully helped me to put some things into perspective about how I've lived my life. It may have bad reviews and not mean much to other people, but thank you Woody Allen, Kate, and the rest. I'll treasure this for years. It's like it was made from my subconscious... Crazy.",5
"  There is something beautiful and poignant about this film. It shows like a play, modern, a Greek tragedy in all its splendor, on the back ground of Cony Island. There is something unreel about the film, the light appears from another world, ever changing, but our human condition is displayed full fletch, a look unforgiving yes but not one of derision, Woody Allen retains compassion and love for his characters throughout, each of them held prisoner in the prison of their type or as it is put in the film, their own fatal flaw. Cate Winslet is absolutely magnificent in the lead role, so is Bellucci. The movie really stayed with me. The ""me too"" movement in my opinion, is only too eager to judge the director, on what ground? - read investigations- no one should weigh on a family dispute and no proofs, the burden of logic and reason falls on Allen's side, most a man is innocent until proven guilty. It shows poorly on ""me too"" and the rest of America, in this case at least here, I see a witch hunt. About his marriage to his adopted daughter, this man chose to live outside our morays, now he pays the price, okay, as far as I am concerned, I see a band of vultures turning overhead. My support goes to Woody Allen, one of the foremost directors of several generations.",5
  Although it has a great cast...the movie was a dud. I was really disappointed ??,2
"  It will be hard to find a movie any yaers as bad as Wonder Wheel. At first I thought maybe it was a dark comedy but soon realied it was suppose to be a drama (!(. Did these actors go blindly into this project not knowing what they were getting themselvesinto? Oscr winning Kate Winslet must be still ""scratching her head.."" Mob wife, father oogling his daughter, a child pyromaniac, wow! The script doesn't make one bit of sense but the cinematography is incredible.",0
"  A very long 1hr 41m., Wonder Wheel feels stilted and like some awfully pretentious am-dram play, clumsily filmed. Winslet seems to be really trying but god knows what source material she's working with.",1
  Waste of my money and time,0
"  I'm going to be a naysayer here and say it's a solid movie. The story, which gives equal parts pity and contempt for the main character, who resides in a world similar to that of Madame bovary and hedda gabler, isn't as solid as i'd like, but the cinematography and acting are too masterful to miss.",4
"  It's gorgeously shot, but at the end of the day, even an all-in Kate Winslet performance can't save this tired, clunky melodrama.",1
"  Only watched it for Kate Winslet. While I endured it until the end due to her perfect acting, not even she could rescue this horrendous movie lacking in everything.",0
"  Scream-filled, Woddy Allen schyzo movie. Need I say more?",1
"  Stilted and wooden, often played as if the characters were reading the script aloud for the very first time ... and yet there is something of a story here, a Southern Gothic if you will but played on New York's dying Coney Island of the 1950's. Strong performances throughout, and I had the feeling that the players literally threw themselves and their trust entirely on writer/director Allen. By the end I realized that most the critics who panned this were wrong. This is a fair work whose drama is like the age it emulates, conflicted, under wraps and straining to be free. I recommend this.",4
"  Whether it is out of boredom or being a Woody Allen die-hard completist, I bite the bullet and stomp up the Euros for his latest film and... wish I hadn't. Once again, Allen regurgitates and revisits stories and themes he has explored in better films before as Wonder Wheel reminds me of Radio Days, Crimes & Misdemeanors and Hannah & Her Sisters; but while he was able to make a few of his recent 're-hashes' interesting if not at least watchable, this underwritten and unengaging mess is about as appealing as week old leftovers. Set in Coney Island in the 1950s, the story of unhappy couple, Ginny and Humpty, the former is having an extramarital affair with lifeguard Mickey and the latter is hiding his daughter from a former marriage from the mobster she married very young, feels like a high schooler imitating Tennesse Williams and it is as clumsy as it is predictable. The characters bumble from one scene to the next in convoluted plotting that it lazily dismisses as fate. I'm not sure if a different cast could have sold it better; but here we have an OTT Jim Belushi and a bland/miscast Justin Timberlake and the result is deadly dull. And who knows if Kate Winslet is doing a bad Blanche Dubois impersonation or just taking the Mickey here (literally) and took the job only to snog Timberlake in multiple scenes. Desperate to find anything redeemable here, the cinematography and production occasionally make the film looks pretty as a seaside postcard, but other times, it just looks cheap and very stagey, leaving us to wonder how a once brilliant filmmaker, known for his verbal dexterity and immensely quotable and amusing dialogue, can lost his magical touch so abominably and ends up with this misconceived turkey.",1
  Pretty bad. More like stageplay than a movie. Didn't make it more than 30 minutes.,1
"  Wonder Wheel shows jealously in its essence. Kate Winslet gives a performance that's her best since the reader. Jim Belushi also gives a great performance, Carried by permaneces and script the movie captures all the ways nature and love have of finding our weakest spots. The cinematography are also great, the colors showing the characters emotions.",4
"  Il n'y a rien qui ressemble plus à un film de Woody Allen qu'un film de Woody Allen et Wonder Wheel en est un exemple parfait. En effet, cette comédie noire qui n'aurait pu être écrite que par l'auteur new-yorkais est encore une fois un plaisir pour les oreilles et surtout pour les yeux, grâce à une photographie absolument fabuleuse de Vittorio Storaro. Cependant, l'oeuvre est tellement marquée Woody Allen qu'elle ne peut convaincre que les adeptes de son style et laisse sur le bas-côté les non amateurs. Dommage pour eux, car ils manquent deux superbes performance par Kate Winslet et Justin Timberlake.",4
"  The dialogue is a bit too heavy-handed and expository, as though Woody Allen was in a hurry to write and publish a theater play in about five days, but the film does have its moments and benefits from a beautiful cinematography and good performances, especially by Kate Winslet.",4
"  An other ""trying too hard, but failing"" movie. It has some good parts, some nice shots, some ok acting but a story, it has none. It is an overly artsy movie, playing too much with colours and forgetting what really counts, having a story or an idea and being able to communicate said story, said idea.",2
  I found this film very nearby. You can get the headaches which the main character is suffering. Good film at all.,4
  The only redeeming quality of this forgettable film is Kate Winslet's performance.,1
"  Woody Allen is now too old to direct anymore, sad but at least he still is a decent writer.",1
"  I liked it. It's better than Caffe Society. Not Allen's best work, but is still him, talking about the nature of relationships. It has a few worthy lines.",4
"  Damn good movie. Kate Winslet, Jim Baluchi, Justin Timberlake were all over and above great. Rolling Stone was the only review to get it right. The small Lincoln Plaza theater was packed. Very strange stuff going on regarding Me Too politics that started with several Fox News anchors and Roger Ailes not Harvey Weinstein via Ronan Farrow.",5
"  When the (beautiful) set has the wanted feel of a theatre play, the story gets all the attention. 30 minutes passed, I was seriously hoping, enduring Kate Winslet´s terrible character´s shouting would reward me with a plot, channeling into a mastermindedly crafted twist of fate, but sadly it did not.",1
"  I know it's not politically correct but I love Woody Allen movies and have been looking forward to Wonder Wheel since I heard it was being made. Filmed in Woody's overstylised way, I loved it! Great performance by Kate Winslet. I loved all the characters even when the story got a little predictable. The critics were way too harsh and I assume this is because of the current sexual assault allegations in the entertainment industry.",4
"  Good period-drama story in Coney Island, and the music was awesome. But the story is a little lacking.",4
"  This is a great movie and Kate Winslet should win the Oscar for best actress. It is not a comedy at all, it is an homage to Eugene O'Neill and Tennessee Williams, most people who don't like this movie probably just don't understand it. Go see it!",5
  One of Allen's great films!,5
"  i have no idea why this does not correspond with the critics. great acting, wonderful moments, visuals, music ... yes, it is a drama and yes, it lacks the humor we´re used to from allen. but that definitely is intentional and it´s an interesting new facet in allen´s late work.",4
  One sometimes wonders what the point of making such a movie is and why it was made. This is one such film. I felt gritty after watching it. Like I'd been dragged through the sand.,1
  Way too depressing for me. My wife liked it though. She saw a lot of humor in it. Not enough for me.,1
  Wonderful like only Woody Allen can do.,5
"  Well one thing you get from this Woody Allen misfire is that you never want to hear that darn Coney Island song again.. he repeats it over and over again throughout the movie. The plot is a mess, the performers are acting like they are in different movies with Kate Winsley doing bad overly emoted theater readings and Justin Timberlake doing who knows what.. the entire film is like a bad stage play that goes nowhere.. definitely one of Woody's weakest efforts.. The cinematography is quite good however, too bad the rest of it is not up to par.",2
"  ""Wonder Wheel"" não está indo bem com os críticos, nem com o público, a julgar pelo Rotten Tomatoes, mas eu gostei bastante. Parece que ele conseguiu fazer aqui o que tentou fazer em Blue Jasmine: construir uma peça à moda dos grandes dramaturgos norte-americanos do século XX. Ele cita O'Neill, mas o primeiro de quem me lembrei foi Tennessee Williams.",4
"  Pros: Cinematography is beautiful - Music, The sets & costumes capturing the 1950s, Distinct characters - childhood arsonist, former actress, high school drop out and gangster's wife, Cons: Very slow pacing in the story, dialogue felt forced, Many scenes seemed like cardboard, Character interactions at times were like mixing peanut butter and guacamole - it just didn't work ""C- rating""",2
  Stop supporting pedophiles.,0
  Definitivno najgori Woodyjev film dosad.,2
"  I listened to some respectable reviewers talking about the show on the radio. I could hear in their voices that they really wanted to like the show, but felt it just didn't come together.I couldn't disagree more. I felt totally involved from wo to go. I felt that I was in t he minds and hearts of all of the characters.Maybe it is just my obsession with New york, but I highly recommend this to anyone who was thinking of seeing it.",0
  You know when Woody Allen isn?t staring in one of his movies they just aren?t any good .,2
"  Time to put a fork in the old adage that a bad Woody movie is better than anything else out there. Trying to figure out why I nodded out several times during WW - was it the crappy dialogue, perhaps the low grade community theater acting of Belushi or the break the fourth wall meanderings of Timberlake. Winslet and Temple give it a try and finally give up half way through. The side story of the firebug stepson is just plain bizarre. Let's not forget the truly annoying song playing throughout this 101 minutes of this Coney Island piece of crap. (12-20-17)",2
"  It feels like Woody Allen is trying to recapture his magic from Blue Jasmine, a character study of a tragic modern Blanche DuBois coming undone by her bad decisions. Whereas that film rightfully garnered Cate Blanchett an Oscar, Wonder Wheel is not going to do much for its own tragic heroine, Kate Winslet. She plays Ginny, and she's stuck in a dull marriage, a dull life as a waitress at a Coney Island diner, and she keeps thinking of the life she could have and should have had as an aspiring actress. She has a summer affair with Mickey (Justin Timberlake), a lifeguard who wants to be a writer with experiences. Ginny's affair is jeopardized when Mickey starts seeing her stepdaughter, Carolina (Juno Temple), who is on the run from her own mobster husband. All of this melodrama is kept at a fever pitch, and the film feels far too stagy, with characters careening in limited locations and having long, combative conversations. The cinematography is gorgeous as sets and people are draped with glowing, amber waves. Winslet's character is not nearly as compelling as Allen intends as a tragic heroine being laid low by her flaws. She's not exactly likeable but she's also not exactly interesting, not like Blue Jasmine. Losing her fling to a younger woman makes her even more desperate and self-destructive, which amplifies Winslet's fussy and broad acting. Timberlake is strangely the narrator of this story and has several fourth wall breaking moments, and it doesn't work, especially since his character is more a cobbled together cipher. There's an odd subplot where Ginny's young son is a pyromaniac and it adds nothing but stress. The story doesn't add up to much and the characters just aren't that interesting; they're loud and abrasive but they don't tap into anything larger about the human condition. It's Allen's half-baked homage to Eugene O'Neill. In a most unexpected move, I think the best actor in this movie is Jim Belushi as Ginny's dimwitted husband. I think that says everything you need to know about Wonder Wheel, an up-and-down melodrama that has its mind set as a theatrical production and never leaves that space.Nate's Grade: C+",4
"  Even though I am a fan of Allen's recent work (Midnight in Paris, Blue Jasmine, even Cafe Society) this movie fell flat. The story line was basic and predictable, and other than a decent performance from Juno Temple, the rest of the cast, specifically Winslet and Belushi, seriously overacted their parts to the point that it wasn't believable. Allen can take chances with who he casts (Dice Clay in Blue Jasmine for example) and it usually pays off, but Belushi seemed like he was out of his league in this movie to begin with.",2
  Not Woody Allens best!,1
  Wonder wheel is worth watching. The way Woody Allen chose to use neon lights colors to portray the actors emotions was really interesting. It was like watching a play on screen and you see the characters grapple with their own individual demons. Kate Winslet was truly amazing she did an amazing job as well as Justin Timberlake and Jim belushi. Don't really understand why critics are being so hard on this movie.,5
"  This is a great film. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. See it for yourself. It's a great morality play with terrific acting by everyone, but especially Kate Winslet. There are no big special effects or chase scenes, just a great story, interesting characters and plot twists that are genuinely surprising. The film itself tells you exactly the kind experience you're going to have when Justin Timberlake introduces himself as our narrator and as an aspiring playwright. If you enjoy drama without any CGI check it out, you won't be disappointed.",5
"  Wonder Wheel is another excellent, intense drama film crafted by Woody Allen's genius. The film also nicely pays a respectable homage to Eugene 'O Neil's common themes on the struggle of family life and Greek mythology. Kate Winslet's brilliant performance will leave you in awe, and Vittorio Storaro's cinematography is gorgeously breath-taking, while dynamically contrasting the existential struggles of the characters in the film. It is a shame that ""objective"" movie critics feel compelled to write negative reviews of this film to avoid the risk of losing their jobs or tarnishing their reputation by not conforming to the so-called ""national conversation"" on sexual harassment. Even the Golden Globes snubbed every aspect of this great film merely because of social-political issues. All works of art should be judged on their own merit!",5
"  Don't listen to the critics. This could be the best acted film of 2017, possible the best acted cinema in over 3 decades. Go see it now in theatres. Kate Winslett will get an Oscar for sure, along w/Juno Temple as best supporting actress and Jim Belushi will get an Oscar as well.",5
"  Woody Allen seems to reflect his awareness of authors O'Neill and Fitzgerald in this rather morbid story. The Wonderwheel overshadows much of the sad drama which unfolds for the audience, somewhat reminiscent of the billboard of T.J. Eckleburg functions in The Great Gatsby. The actors' performances stand alone for audience satisfaction, but let us leave the theater wondering why we were there otherwise.",2
  The movie comes together enough for me. I like seeing Woody Allen try drama and It may be sour grapes driving the negative reviews. Why is an unflattering portrayal of the female character so important but seeing women beat up and abused in other films is so appealing. Allen tries to tell a story but the critics want something more sensational than a character study.,0
  Winslet great acting; but I leave it a 1.,0
"  One of the most disappointing and depressing films I have seen in many years. I get it. Woody Allen finds angst really appealing. I don't. This is a study in grimey, hopeless misery. I was hoping Kate Winslet and Justin Timberlake would offer strong performances. They didn't. Jim Belushi was routinely awkward. The only redeeming aspect of the film was the F/X that recreated 1950s Coney Island. The rest was a pretentious, artsy exercise in Woody Allen's self-indulgence.",1
"  Woody Allen has directed about 53 films, averaging one a year for the past 50 years, and about 1 out of 5 are very good or excellent, 30 bearable to watch and the rest are pretty bad, to which he can add ""Wonder Wheel"". It is as if he didn't give Justin Timberlake any direction and just told Kate Winslet to be Cate Blanchett in ""Blue Jasmine"", who was a rip-off of Blanche Dubois in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", and it is the first time I can remember feeling she was just doing a bad acting job or was, at least, in a different movie. Seeing either of them on screen, saying trite sentences, was painful except for some beautiful lit headshots of her. Who sabotages her most is Woody Allen, the writer, with some of the tritest sentences ever uttered on screen with poor imitations of Williams, Eugene O'Neill and others.Jim Belushi seemed to be a combination of Stanley, without the body but the attitude, and Mitch in ""Streetcar"", while Juno Temple starts off as an uninteresting part of the film but develops her character nicely as the film comes towards the finish.Now if I could only figure out why Jack Gore, as a child from Winslet's first husband, is a pyromaniac and why he is even in the movie.Without getting into the whole Woody Allen-Mia Farrow-Dylan Farrow-Soon-Yi Previn aspects which is reflected in today's news this is definitely one of Allen's worst pictures as a director and writer and, for the first time, I felt Allen even got the music track wrong, completely annoying.The stars of ""Wonder Wheel"" are not Allen but cinematographer Vittoria Storaro and Santo Loquasto the production designer.",1
"  Same old misogynistic Allen take on women. Please crawl under a rock with Weinstein and the rest, we are SO over this.",0
  a true melodrama of dysfunction but they drank budweiser beer not schaffer,5
  overacting..at the worst...,1
  What a stinker. I can't believe critics are at 32% and audience is at 57%.,0
"  I had looked forward to seeing this since I first heard about it earlier this year.... The trailer was gorgeous and with Winslet being one of my all-time favorites, it seemed to have ""awards season"" written all over it. But, sadly the film is a major miss. It's slow, monotonous, overly stagey and practically pointless. Despite being visually pleasing, there is nothing to save it. Kate Winslet often seems utterly bored and uninspired in her role. Justin Timberlake seems completely out of place in every scene. The quirky humor found in most Allen films is missing, minus a few run-on giggles that get old fast. This one ranks very low on Woody Allen's efforts. BLAH! (2 of 5 stars)",2
"  While stunning visually, this latest offering from Woody Allen has to rank among the worst of his offerings. With leads that are horribly miscast (especially Kate Winslet in a bombastic exercise of overacting), writing that's seriously bloated and in need of retooling, and characters who are neither likable nor believable, the film tells a tale that in many ways feels like a working class 1950s retread of ""Blue Jasmine"" with elements of ""Cafe Society"" thrown in. As much of a fan as I am of the director's work, I whole-heartedly recommend skipping this one -- and hope that he gets back on track with his next project.",1
  Enjoyed it despite the critique.,5

  Screw the haterz. Loved it.,5
"  I did not love ""Bad Moms"", but there were some things to like about it. The movie is well cast and there were some very clever jokes scattered through out the movie (The best being the scene at the bar where Mila Kunis' character keeps saying the wrong thing to every man she meets.). However the same cannot be said for this terrible sequel. All of the jokes fall flat. I did not laugh once. The characters of the mothers are so intensely dislikeable it's no mystery at all why their daughters initially wanted nothing to do with them! The performances in the film are all way below par which is especially surprising given the amount of talent among the cast. Also it could not have been more obvious that at the last possible minute all would be forgiven and the respective families would be whole again. We have seen that in more sitcoms than it is possible to count. ""Bad"" is the perfect way to describe this movie. I wonder why the Golden Raspberry Awards Foundation overlooked this piece of garbage.",1

"  Some extremely funny parts in this movie. Other parts seemed like they were trying to fill time to be a full-length movie - they could have been funnier or left out.

  Absolutely awful movie. Seems like they forced the issue with profanity and it made for ridiculous dialogue. Just terrible. Not funny in the slightest.,5
  I thought it was hilarious,4
  It was a pretty shitty movie as expected but I was just in the mood for something shallow and vulgar as this one. They were right about one thing though; mother - daughter relationships are complicated.,2
"  had a bunch of really funny parts and generally made me laugh a lot. but really heavy on the drama and emotional stuff, significantly more than the previous movie. and it just wasn't as well made. overuse of montages, some really lame scenes. and they went completely overboard in some parts, really unrealistic things happen, the movie becomes kind of a joke, which is fine if it's that kind of movie, but it isn't. and please please stop using the lame opening scene from a later time and then go back to the start. if it doesn't serve a purpose, don't do it. they just try to get your attention. it should be used to enhance the story or make things a surprise, but so often like in this movie, all it does it tell you what will happen later, which is idiotic (1 viewing)",2
"  Despite sporting a nearly identical plot to the Daddy's Home sequel, it's not quite as atrocious - there are a couple laughs, almost all of which Christine Baranski and Kathryn Hahn are responsible for. It's still absolutely a below average comedy who feels like it's stretching out its (at times interminable feeling) run time with endless slow motion ""WE ARE HAVING FUN"" sequences. Totally forgettable, but not offensive, and might be enjoyable by a very drunken group of its target demographic.",2
"  It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't very good either. Really wish this wasn't made.",2
"  I knew from the start that this one wouldn't be much of an improvement from the contrived stillborn original, but I paid a dollar something on Redox thinking I would at least get a couple of smiles, hopefully a laugh out loud moment. Precisely what I got. The most annoying aspect of the film was the third person narrative. It's obvious this movie wasn't written by women but rather a man speaking on how he thinks stuff a woman would say. In particular ""the perfect etc..."" Perfect this, perfect that. Shut up already. I'm writing this review and the movie still ain't over. I lost interested once Mila Kunis had her forced arch.",1
"  More of the same, yet not as good as its predecessor. It's got some cringeworthy moments, but there's some funny bits to be had. All mashed up with the typical mushy sentiment by the end. Pretty much what you'd expect from a movie like this.",2

  another bad comedy movie the only thing that i giving it 1.5 it is because kiki and her mother,1
"  I really don't get all of the bad reviews for this movie. I had such a good laugh the whole time. It's not a serious movie, it's a fun movie and to that end, you really do have fun. They don't take themselves too seriously and neither should we. Highly recommended for a good laugh at the end of a day when you don't need anymore serious stuff to think about.",5
"  Even with good intentions, A Bad Moms Christmas fails to delivers a full entertaining comedy, sometimes is likeable, but overall you miss some balance between the characters and a more effective humor. (2,5/5)",2
  so much fun. I will watch it again for sure.,5
  the more I read the reviews on this site the more I am convinced most don't watch the movie but just jump on the bandwagon so they can get the title of 'top critic'. this movie has no redeeming qualities. 100% bad.,0
  So bad compared to the first. I was really looking forward to this movie and felt so disappointed.,2
"  Much, much funnier than the very funny original. It does have a low budget feel, which is fine. Watch for Peter Gallagher reprising his character from While You Were Sleeping. Kathryn Hahn is a force of nature in this.",5
  didn't like it very good,2
  Loved it. My husband and I watched it on video. Usually sequals arrent worth watching but this movie was so funny.,5
"  So stupid ......couldn't even get through it , not funny",1
"  Three overburdened young moms try to meet and then rebel against the challenges of Super Bowl for moms"" - a perfect Christmas.It's a sequel to Bad Moms"" released in 2016 summer which turned out to be quite a breakout hit, earning over 180 million cinema dollars against the 20 mil budget.Ah, the grrl power comedies, the cute but mostly unfunny younger sister of American mainstream comedies which were kickstarted by 2011's hit Bridesmaid"", and Hollywood's eager wish to prove that women can be funny too.Well anybody can funny, of course, but you can't really create a noteworthy all-female comedy without decent script and performances, and/or actresses' ability to improvise, and this is where the new grrl power comedies fall short usually.A Bad Moms Christmas"" is a good example of this. Like many mainstream comedies, it has enough of everything to get the ball rolling, but the result feels so humorless and lacking that you will probably start checking your watch/phone before it reaches midpoint, at latest.One problem is the generic screenplay, the other is the fact that despite all the talent involved, the story centers on three leading ladies, two of which are not good enough performers to carry this movie.Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell are always decent supporters but they lack the acting range and presence to justify carrying a comedy. I am not even sure that they have enough star power to justify lead parts in a budding comedy franchise.So it's up to third lead Kathryn Hahn to do most of the the heavy lifting, and she's solid as usual, being able to entertain, display some acting chops and create emotional connection with the audience.All the other players are relegated to the sidelines, and have little screen time or almost nothing interesting to do. But they do it well, so I am gonna name them all:* Christine Baranski, Susan Sarandon, and Cherly Hines as the bad moms of the bad moms visiting for Christmas - all veteran actresses, all giving much better performances than Bell and Kunis;* Jay Hernandez, Peter Gallagher, Justin Hartley, Lyle Brocato - various love interests of bad moms, mostly there for decoration. Hartley is surprisingly memorable as male stripper with golden heart.The introduction of his character, an affectionate conversation during balls and anus waxing, is probably the best part of the whole movie, both warm and funny. I was as surprised as you probably are reading this.* Wanda Sykes, Christina Applegate, Cade Mansfield Cooksey - quick comedy reliefs, little screen time but a great value to the whole movie. If Bad Moms 2"" will make you laugh at all, then it would probably happen thanks to them.I've seen some good modern christmas comedies, such as Elf"" and The Bad Santa"", but this is not one of them. A Bad Moms Christmas"" is just never funny.The first hour is watchable but unremarkable, the remaining 45 minutes are just too cliche-y and frankly boring to care.Also, I was surprised to find that ""Bad Moms 2"" is rated R in the U.S. cinemas - for crude sexual content and language throughout, and some drug use. Because compared to possibly every other modern raunchy comedy I have seen, it sure feels meek and mild. They even manage to make the promising end-credits dance number as unsexy as possible.So... Avoid it, till it reaches Netflix or something, or when you desperately need some comedy you haven't seen yet.By the way, Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, the writing-directing team behind the franchise, are already planning the spin-off Bad Dads"".Probably gonna be as hollow and sackless as, say, Horrible Bosses"". I am surprised if they will not try to bring in Jason Sudeikis or Jason Bateman, the charming crownprinces of sackless modern comedy movies.",2
"  Over the top, shock humour seriously drags this down. There are glimpses of what could be a decent story but the characters are one-dimensional and the jokes are painfully unfunny.",2
  I thought this movie was funny and even better than the first bad moms movie. It made me smile and laugh which I think is a good thing for a movie to do. The actresses were great. I would recommend this movie.,4
"  Plot: The three underappreciated moms from the original return for a Christmas with the unexpected arrival of their respective mothers, each of whom causes problems for their daughters.Strengths: One of the things that made the first Bad Moms work so well was the talented cast of mothers. Mila Kunis (Amy Mitchell) is a solid lead, Kristen Bell (Kiki) is always delightful and Kathryn Hahn (Carla Dunkler) is a hilarious scene stealer. Their chemistry was one again the strongest aspect of the film.Weaknesses: Even with the leads doing their best together, so much just fell way short. Almost every joke they utter left me sitting there, completely unamused. All three women, and their mothers, have a tendency to be funny, yet this script failed them miserably. The jokes are flat out bad and unfunny. The mothers were all giant clichés. Sandy (Cheryl Hines) was overbearing, Isis (Susan Sarandon) was overly ""cool"" and out for money from her daughter, and Ruth (Christine Baranski) was the super judgmental mother. They're all tropes we've seen in sitcoms and such in the past. Everything was also way over the top, to the point where it was worth eye rolls and groans instead of laughs.Overall: The worst movie I saw from 2017. The first Bad Moms as a fun surprise, but this was a major letdown. It felt like a rushed script for a cash grab led to an unfunny film with poor, generic characters.",1
  Script was terrible. They tried WAY too hard to be rauncy and funny and was desperate.,1
  not as good as the first one,2
"  let it go.. A Bad Moms ChristmasCarrying the whole movie on a script of a daily soap episode is too much even for 104 minutes runtime since the only thing you rely on are some verbal sequences between Mila, Kirsten and Kathryn which are quite funny",1
  What starts out as nothing more than glorified drunken stupidity amongst bored housewives actually ends up not being half bad. There are definitely some funny moments and as far as delivering that essential Christmas message of peace and goodwill this does a good job. Far better than I thought it would be.,5
"  This film ticked all the right boxes. Great cast, humor, sexual innuendos and much more. This film was made for the people who want to laugh receive some life lessons through comedy and overall make people happy. No need to dissect the movie more than that. I feel as though people reviewing on this platform take themselves to seriously.",5
"  Fact this came out worse than the original and can't seem to know why. Maybe its because the new characters just turned out bland, the humor literally crashed as hard as a crack head off adderall and for the most of the time, I couldn't seem to understand the direction in which the movie was going. I don't know what went wrong in this sequel but it just strayed too far from its original concept.",2
"  Unlike Daddy's Home 2, this is not nearly as good as its predecessor. Still, it's mindless fun, especially for you moms out there.",2
"  not really sure what to say. this was simply atrocious to watch. the dialogues, the actors, the story and pretty much every gag which they tried so hard to shove down the viewers throat, all failed. horrible cheap montages even the score and especially the camera work sucked. wow... just wow",1
  Only a slight step above watching a bare ass farting on screen for 90mins. Hollywood takes us one step closer to Idiocracy.,1
  I always worry about a sequel and it started off slow for me but once it picked up..I don't know...it's a battle between the first movie and this one! Both were very unique and hilarious! My jaw hurt after watching this! It's hard to find a good comedy but they nailed it!,5
  Cringy and wanted to leave the cinema! Not funny and way over the top!,0
  Gets you into the spirit,5
"  The script feels like the result of dumping a thousand printed-out jokes into a paper bag, shaking it up, and pulling them out at random. Sure, there are some funny jokes, but overall, it feels disjointed. There's nothing clever or surprising about it.",0
"  worst Movie of the year, plot is insulting to humanity and a reflection of everything that is wrong with the world.",0
  Me gusto esta película por que encerio me divertí con la trama y con la comedia.I liked this movie because I really enjoyed the plot and the comedy.,5
"  Went with friends for a girls night out and laughed out loud and had a great time. There were even a few teas in the church scene. Sequels are always a challenge because they don't have the surprise factor of the first move, but if you liked the first movie, this one will not disappoint. It is the same characters, tackling the stress of the holidays and the pressure Moms are under to make the perfect Christmas for everyone. If you don't take it too seriously and go for a good laugh, you will enjoy it!",4
  Very funny light hearted movie. A great Christmas watch.,5
"  Mining similar territory as 'Daddy's Home 2' with only marginally better results, this hastily assembled sequel to last year's sleeper hit finds our trio of overworked matriarchs butting heads with their own mothers over the holidays. As a result, the film's leads (Mila Kunis, Kathryn Hahn and Kristen Bell) spend most of the movie apart, a mistake considering their winning chemistry. Of the three individual storylines, the underrrated Hahn fares best - her boozy, foul-mouthed Carla could easily carry a movie of her own. That being said, the ample use of profanity feels like a placeholder for actual jokes, making the end result a paler, less satisfying version of the original. Still, it does feature Kenny G actually saying the words ""It's not a flute, bitch""...no other movie can make that boast.",2
  cheap movie and story line ...,1
  I wanted to see a movie that would make me laugh. This did it.,4
"  I love a bawdy, cheesy holiday movie but this is just pathetic. By the end of the movie, you're only wondering how much money these women got to debase themselves with such a horrible script.",2
"  Absolutely not funny. You actually come out feeling bad. The kids and the grandmas scripts were unfunny, not realistic. Uncomforablely not fun or funny.",1
"  Love, love, love! I wasn't sure this movie would be able to live up to the comedy in the first movie but it did. I laughed, I cried, and I definitely enjoyed every minute of this movie. Can't wait to watch it again!",5
"  It would be difficult to comment on this movie in terms of quality of movie itself. With this type of movie all that should count is if it's silly, funny, and makes a good escape from reality for both Moms and Grandmas. Too bad it's so in the gutter with sex and language. Why don't writers try to get beyond the shock value of having a what appears to be 7 year old repeat the phrase ""oh my f-ing God""? Maybe because they aren't talented enough to write anything else. It's the equivalent of fart jokes by your 7th grade friend, and it's lazy, lazy, lazy. Don't give Hollywood your money or your vote on this one. Stay home and be a good Mom.",0
  Funny all the way through.,4
  This movie was great! I have seen both movies and they both made me laugh. I'm happy I seen this!!,5
"  garbage, editor should be fired because this glowing effect on the whole fucking movie",0
  Christmas sequel that's nowhere near as funny as the original,2
"  There are some real laughs in this movie, but not enough depth to warrant any real recommendation.",2
"  I could copy paste the review from ""Daddy's Home 2"" take out the part about the cast and add that it is worse than the original and that sums up this movie. Not worth seeing.",0
  Absolutely outrageous!!!!,5
  It was funny. I'm glad I went to see it. I'm glad I'm not a part of those families.,4
  just as good as the first and even better!!!,5
"  A good movie but not too much, made me laugh a lot but was too disturbed I loved the first film.",2
"  The chemistry of Mila and her friends is just so awesome. These movies are a great series, and one that i really don't seem to get tired of watching!",5
"  very, very funny, and insightful as well. if you liked the first one. you should like the sequel. hahn dominated the first one, and is very good again, but the brilliantly cast moms of the moms stand out in this one.",5
  I thought this round was just as good if not better and had a great meaning in the end!,5
"  Cliche Cliche Cliche...Same storyline as part 1 which made us hate it even more. Forced emotions in the movie and trying to be sentimental but didn't work well. Didn't laugh that much and it was ""karwata"" we khalas. Daddy's Home 2 got them this time as it's almost the same idea but they executed much MUCH better!",2
  I wasn't expecting much but it had me laughing out loud.,4
  a few laughs and family values amidst cheap muck,2
  I think should be considered an insult to women everywhere. the plot is predictable that's if we even call it a plot. not funny in the least. terrible,1
"  Hated the first one, should've known better and not wasted my time on the sequel.",1
  just ridiculously bad!!!,1
  Love it it's a funny festive film bound to make you laugh out loud.,5
  I highly recommend you sneak in booze. We laughed until we were sweating. It had it's dull moments but still very funny.,4
"  They got a little confused with the basis for the Bad Moms idea, but the characters are likable and it was still funny. Christine Baranski was over the top.",4
"  It was ok, but I liked the first one better.",2
  Was really funny. Glad I ignored the reviews and saw it with my girlfriends. It's not for everyone but was definitely funny throughout the whole movie!,4
  Horrible movie. I felt embarrassed for the entire cast. Lost two hours of my life that I will never get back. Waste of money,0
"  so funny, cute chick flick",5
  Worst movie we've seen in a very long time. Would've walked out if hadn't been with friends.,1
  Absolutely hilarious! Story line was better in the first movie but this one was still pretty good.,5
"  Going to this film was a sort of odd compromise -- we had not really intended to see it at a theater. However, because of the terrific cast, we went. There are moments of humor, mostly raw and, frankly, mostly because of who was saying the lines. This is an extremely poorly written and directed movie. There was a chance for this baby to be something, instead, the production team clearly strangled it in the cradle. Susan Sarandon got off a couple of real zinger lines, and the moments between her, Cheryl Hines, and Christine Baranski had some real power, and humor. I suspect there is a ""Bad Grandmas"" in Vegas movie idea percolating here.But overall, this movie is a profane, muddled mess masquerading as a movie.Don't bother seeing it in the theater, wait for it to come to cable, then skip it there as well.",1
  a complete waist of time and energy,0
  Poor lazy attempt at a unnecessary sequel.,2
  Everyone has a little bit if these 6 moms in them. Funny romp through the pressures of Christmases past.,4
"  Wasn't as good as the first, but I laughed from start to finish and left entertained. I recommend it for a good laugh.",4
"  Not bad, the first film was better but the main character's mothers were hilarious!!!",2
  Two stars is being kind.,2
  Love this franchise! Bad Mom's Easter next please!,5
  was a very funny film,5
  Maybe I liked the 1st one too much! I was let down by this movie....Not enough natural laughs....very forced...It had some good/funny moments. The cast was excellent...that is part of what makes you have higher expectations. Shame on the writers and director and on second thought the Actors for not demanding a better script! Disappointment,2
"  OMG Ladies, a must see ! Hilarious!! And i'm not even a mom. Loved it like the first one !",4
"  This definitely put me in the holiday spirit ??????. When a movie about Christmas and kids and chaos actually sparks a little bit of my potential parent heart, that's something to notice ??. Super fun cast, enjoying full out silliness all the way. ???? Merry times! Yes, a smaller less clever story than the original, but a great little festive sequel that definitely made me laugh.",4
  Hilarious. I am not sure why so many bad ratings? I laughed from beginning to end.,5
"  This movie was very boring and stale When watching it all I could think about is how much better every movie I've even seen was this was the second worst movie I've even seen besides ""The shallows"" Daddy's Home 2 is a better watch if your lookin for a good night at the movies",0
  Hilariously entertaining and possibly even funnier than the first one!,5
  Very disappointed. This film starts out just as good as the first left off and after the grandma's show up everything including the story and the jokes just fall flat.,2
  Horrible! Trying to make light of mothers with narcissistic personality disorder. Not funny at all. The dynamic between the three main character that was so funny to watch in the first movie was gone. They were hardly a part of the movie. Bad jokes and a dumb story line. The first one was so funny and even the raunchy humor worked well in it. This one is terrible and the raunchier humor just came across as trashy. I fell asleep and then left before it was over. Those poor actors had to be so disappointed in what the writers made of their once-cute story. Don't bother seeing.,0
  I thought it was really funny!,4
  Don't take your kids to THIS one. LOL Definitely raunchy. Still.. a few good laughs. Just an 'okay' film.,2
"  I have watched Bad Mom 1 before and wanted to check out the second one. In general, the second ones are generally disappointing to compare the first one. However, I found this bad mom 2 Christmas is more fun and hilarious than the first one. There is a major theme about ""being a mom"", what it means for each characters and three main characters have their distinctive struggles in relationship with their own moms in disfuncyional ways.. there are very touching moments that audiences feel very related to ... you should watch it.",5
"  yeah the first one was better, yeah this was alot of the same...this was still a solid funny flick that had my wife and I laughing throughout",4
"  Horrible. Walked out it was so bad. Although there were a few laughs, the movie is just over the top ""trying"" to be funny. Failed miserably",0
"  I didn't like the need to use ""f**k"" constantly, especially by young kids. Not cool. Not even necessary.",2
  I just saw this movie. I thought it was hilariously funny. I happen to like crude and raunchy humor and this movie was right up my alley. It made me laugh so hard I cried tears at one point. I personally don't see why people have been giving it a bad rating.,5
  So they toke Christmas back by working harder overnight and men did not help at all. Great job,1
  Awesome! Laughed the whole time!,5
"  Total waste of time and resources. Crude, foul language and drug use....could win an Oscar.",1
"  Nice humor, enjoyed all gje scenes.",4
  Unfunny.. same old modern humour with vulgar jokes,1
"  A pretty subpar sequel to a pretty damn funny original. The follow up to Bad Moms (2016) and in my opinion one of the funniest movies of last year. This one just kinda keeps beating the jokes from the last movie into ya. The film follows the three moms from the last film: we have Amy (Mila Kunis) who is trying to have a chill Christmas with her kids until her mom Ruth (Christine Baranski) shows up and starts judging every little thing she starts doing, we have Kiki (Kristen Bell) who is also celebrating Christmas until her mom Sandy (Cheryl Hanes) arrives. The issue with Sandy is that she's extremely close with Kiki to the point of it being very weird. Then finally we have Carla (Kathryn Hahn) who is not exactly celebrating Christmas, but her mom Isis (Susan Sarandon) shows up asking for money. All in all you get the patterns here. The sequel brings the original leading ladies mothers into the fray and in all honesty it just never works. Amy and Ruth have the best story out of them all since it actually has some heart, but Kiki's and Carlas are just there to try and be funny. The films bad moms aren't even the leading ladies anymore, but are the Grandparents overall. The reason I liked the first film was because the relationship between the main three moms was hilarious, but we only get one scene like that in this one. Overall, this one was a dud. It's barely funny which is a disappointment because the first one was great. Skip this one.",2
"  The beginning felt rushed, we were giving no real time to get to know the characters and there was no real reason why Amy went so crazy so quickly. The jokes felt recycled and the story was disjointed.",2
  So many good laughs!!!,4
  wasn't even near as funny as the first one... btw no one wants to watch a movie where its based on daughters trying to repair relationships with there shitty mothers..,0
"  Well, some scenes made me laugh and it's a bit cliche...",2
  Straight Up Tromboner,0
"  Funny! Just what you need for a girls night! A movie for grown women. People complaining about the language may not have noticed it was rated R before seeing it. I love the three main characters. This movie is more slapstick then the original, but it is silly and fun!",4
"  It had a good storyline and was funny but the language was absolutely horrific!!! A child (maybe 5 or 6) kept dropping the ""F"" bomb and the adults did not even correct her because they were too busy saying the same thing - that kind of language throughout the movie is not necessary. I was extremely disappointed.",0
"  With no title screen till the end again, that is just a stupid way to do movies these days. This was no where as good as the first one. This time it is all about the grandmas and how each one ruins the moms christmas. I did not find this as funny as the first one. There were some moments but most of them just sucked. No really a good comedy. Watch the first one and not this one. All I am ever going to remember from this movie is the kid saying oh my f****** god like 5 times.",2
  Cute movie was quite funny,4
  Hit and miss comedy. Some parts hard the whole audience laughing upruptly. It was very stupid comedy at points. Total chick flick. My girlfriend enjoyed it much more then I.,2
"  This is something that needs to be said when reviewing pretty much every comedy out there, but the comedy genre is subjective and many people don't really like when a movie is raunchy just to be funny. That being said, A Bad Moms Christmas is a sequel that improves on the original in my opinion. That doesn't seem to be a very popular thing to say about this movie, but I'm always honest about how I feel about a movie, never letting other critics decide how I should feel about a film. I truly believe that A Bad Moms Christmas is a much funnier, more heartfelt, and more genuine film than the original. Yes, the premise itself is as stale as they come and the conclusion of the movie is as predictable as ever, but if you enjoyed the raunchiness of the first movie, I just have to call it like I see it and say that I had a much better time with the sequel, and I thought the first was fine. Here's why you should check out this movie if this is your type of comedy.The first movie revolved around a group of women who rebelled against the school system, becoming cool moms for their kids and having a blast outside and even sometimes inside of school. Cursing and getting into hilarious antics is really what made the first movie work so well, so all I was hoping for was more of the same, but done with a little more care. Being a holiday film, this sequel deals with having each of their moms over for the holidays and once again having arguments, getting into silly antics, and yes, a lot of cursing ensues. Quite honestly, this movie delivers for fans of the first and actually had a final act that felt a little too familiar, but it was done well and didn't really feel all that contrived to me.There is a much more emotional turn than I was expecting here. Yes, it's a holiday film and it's going to give you life lessons about family and its importance, but I was genuinely touched by a few lines of dialogue, mainly because I enjoy watching these three women on-screen together. I know there's nothing too special about a movie like this, but there have been far worse comedies in recent memory. This year has been pretty poor in terms of delivering a solid yuck-fest, so I believe this ranks among the few good ones of 2017.Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell are great players throughout these two films, but Kathryn Hahn is once again the show-stealer here. Delivering hilarious one-liners and being the raunchiest of the group, she really does earn a lot of laughs from audiences. Once again, this is a very raunchy movie and sometimes jokes are overused a little too much, but that's why I recommend this movie to a very specific audience that enjoys the raunchier type of humor or those who aren't offended very easily. If you can forgive the mean nature of many of the jokes here, I think you'll have a good time at the movies.In the end, A Bad Moms Christmas does literally nothing new for the genre, but its raunchy nature, along with a great trio of lead actresses, really makes it a harmlessly enjoyable flick at the cinema. Joined by newcomers Susan Sarandon, Christine Baranski, and Cheryl Hines, A Bad Moms Christmas makes itself out to be the unlikely holiday treat that I don't think anyone was expecting. Yes, there are many arguments that can be made in terms of how this has a very lackluster premise, but in the end, this film exists to bank off the original film and try to get some laughs out of its audience, and I laughed the entire way through. If you just want to escape for a few laughs at the theatre, A Bad Moms Christmas may just be your ticket.",4
  Bogie the first and the second have potential. That?s it..,1
"  Thought it was hilarious. I laughed so hard. It?s maybe not as good as the first one but a strong contender. If you are easily offended, it?s not the movie for you.",4
  Loved the movie! laughed from beginning until end!! all 6 of these ladies had amazing chemistry.,5
"  Can I rate it less than 1-star? Worst. Movie. Ever.This is the first time I've ever felt like walking out of a theater...if I hadn't been with girlfriends, I would have. The vulgarity this time around was extreme, (and unnecessary):even the one poignant moment between mother and daughter at the Midnight Mass contained the F-expletive. Really?! Mila Kunis and her girl friends had one goal: to save Christmas. My recommendation to movie watchers: save your own Christmas by avoiding this disaster.",1
  Not on my life would I waste 2 hrs on this movie.,0
"  So the bad moms are back! And now they will see their parents are they going to have fun with them and have a good Christmas with there family well I will leave that to you to find out, but such a funny movie I keep laughing a lot when I saw this movie! You know it would be great if they made a SQL!!",5
"  Felt just as funny as the first one, with new story line that was somewhat similar.",4
"  The moms and the dads duking it out this Christmas with almost similar materials, and the winner is clearly the daddies, cause they stretched their PG-13 rating as far as possible, while the moms failed to take advantage of their R rating...The moms was much better the first time around though...",2
  Not sure why people didn?t like this movie?? The group I saw it with all laughed throughout entiremovie!,5
"  I thought it was cute! For full disclosure, I have not yet seen the first movie, but I went to this movie looking for light-hearted, fun holiday-themed entertainment, and I found it. It's neither a ""deep"" movie nor high drama, but it is not intended to be either of those things. It's both fun and funny, and the casting is excellent. In particular, Christine Baranski really shines in her role as an over-the-top perfectionist mother.",4
  funnier than i thought it would be,4
  going to see this movie I only knew I loved the first bad moms and really expected nothing less from the sequel and trust me it was well worth seeing people are giving it bad reviews I know but I can't see how the movie I saw was hilarious and heartfelt it really gets you ready for Christmas such a good dose of Christmas,4
  This actually made me laugh out loud. It takes a lot to make me laugh,4
  It was soooooo funny!!!!!!! I loved it!!!!!!!!,5
  TERRIBLE MOVIE PLEASE Avoid,0
  I will have to see it again for all the things I missed from laughing so hard. Love the chemistry of these girls & their moms ??????,5
  Actually a really funny movie. I'm glad I enjoyed it as much as I did. Justin Hartley coming into this film was hillarious.,5
  Thought it would be funnier. Great comedic actors with a bad script. Was waaaay to serious at he end,2
"  The first one was muuuch better. This one felt a bit rushed, and therefore did not make the connection. Its unfortunate because we really enjoyed the first one, and I looove Susan Sarandon...tons!! Unfortunately for us this was a fail ??",2
"  A Bad Moms Christmas may have fell into that comedy sequel flaw were the first movie was pure laughs and fun. And this sequel may have some moments were it can be funny, but overall it fell a little boring compared to the first movie. I enjoyed the first with Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, and Kathryn Hahn playing mothers who are so overworked and unappreciated. They decide to take control of their own lives to have a little fun. Sure, there are some hilarious moments in this film. But it was not enough to carry the rest of the movie. Amy (Mila Kunis), Kiki (Kristen Bell), and Carla (Kathryn Hahn) are under appreciated and overworked trying to get ready for Christmas. They all get surprised by their mothers visiting them for the holidays. Then, there comes the drama with Amy's mother being the high maintenance snob, Kiki's mother being too clingy and attached to her daughter still, and Carla's mother who is a dead beat and only sees the daughter when she needs something. Straight to the point, Bad Moms Christmas had some fun laughable moments. A scene were Amy, Kiki, and Carla get a little drunk before they do some shopping at the mall. Kind of a familiar concept like the first movie, were they were trashing a grocery store. Also, a scene were they are at skyzone and playing dodgeball with their kids and their mothers also participated was also a lot of fun. But the movie does fail with having a plot. It is all about mothers struggling through the holidays, and there mothers show up to either wreck there peaceful holiday or give them a little meaningful message about how to handle there own personal life. There was a lot of moments were there was not many jokes or laughs happening. Especially, in the more dramatic moments when Amy and there mother part ways after a party that turned for a disaster in her house. And her mother and the other two mothers chat away about how they all mistreated their daughters. Overall, Bad Moms Christmas is a bad film. It has some brief jokes and laughs. But not as good as the first film. Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, and Kathryn Hahn were great but the script was lacking in a more fun plot and humor. I rate the film 2.5 out of 5 stars. I recommend the film as a rental.",2
  I laughed so hard because all the cast was hysterical!,5
"  This movie was just ok. I don't know why it was necessary to name the lady isis, faking cancer, saying something about bombing a car, the lady calling the guy jesus instead of jesse, telling the hispanic guy to take the bags up and bunch of little stuff. Things that shouldn't be included in there that are offensive.",0
  WOW THIS WAS SO BAD I FEEL CHEATED,0
"  So much fun! I loved every minute. I laughed, I cried, I peed my pants!",5
  Saw the first one three times and have seen this one once (have plans to go next week). As long as you know what to expect you will love it. My 79-year-old mother (who thinks crap is a bad word) laughed so hard she cried at both of them.,5
"  Extremely funny film, a must see this holiday season!",4
  I have no idea why people gave this a bad review. This was hilarious. I laughed throughout the entire movie.,4
"  Haven't seen the first one so can't say how it compares, but I thought this was great. Easy to watch, a bit silly but with lots of laughs and a great Christmas ending :D",5
"  Everyone in the cast was hilarious. It was extremely entertaining, crude, and very funny. 7/10",4
"  This movie is exactly what it was meant to be. A hysterical look into the lives of moms dying the holidays, and how their own moms can drive them crazy. It?s not going to win any oscars, but they?re not trying to. If you don?t like raunchy or inappropriate humor, you won?t like it. Otherwise, just enjoy this film for what it is.",4
"  Such a funny movie! Theater was packed. Don't know why rotten tomatoes gave it a low rating. I would go see it again. That's how good it was. If you liked bridesmaids, if you liked the hangover. If you want to see an amazing comedy. Go see this movie.",5
"  Although I didn't laugh as much as I did during the first one, I was pleasantly surprised at how it ended, and how much I enjoyed it. I would highly recommend it!",5
  very funny Bad Moms sequel which for sure put the 1st one to shame. it was very whitty and somewhat of a stupid comedy but was very enjoyable.,4
  Very funny movie! I laughed out loud as did the rest of the audience. Don't know why critics review is low. It's a light hearted comedy nothing deep!,5
  Flipppin' HILARIOUS!!!,5
  Jokes were as bad as the movie ....,1
"  Worth a watch if no other options, but a poor sequel given how funny the first instalment was",2
"  Worst movie I've ever seen. Walked out after 15 minutes of cringe-worthy ""acting"", horrible writing and terrible attempts at comedy.",0
  Not as good as the first one and to much slo mo.,2
"  I really enjoyed this movie...It's not for everybody, but it definitely made me laugh!",4
  Terrible and disgusting movie,0
  The first one was much better. Barely laughed...,1
  dam good movie could not stop laughing,5
"  So Funny! This one was so much more funnier than the first.Lots of cussing and nasty talk, so I wouldn?t bring kids.",4
  Hysterical! I laughed so hard!!!!,5
"  From reading all of the reviews that stated that 'it was soooo much better than the first one,' I guess I saw a different movie. A few laughs and funny scenes that were on par with what made the first one good, but overall fell flat. Kathryn Hahn carried the movie and had the movie's only real laughs and zingers.",2
  Absolutely hysterical. Lot;s of laughs and the whole audience was in hysterics.,5
"  I saw snippets for some of the scenes and thought, ""Wow, I can't wait to see how they end up in this situation. I bet it'll be funny."" In reality, they were in that situation because it was a day that ended in 'y' and the producers wanted to churn this sequel out as quickly as possible. There was no build up to the hijinks. They happened because they were expected, not as a consequence to the sequence of events the characters experienced. This was thematic throughout the entire film.",1
"  Don't waste your money seeing Bad Mom's Christmas. I'm not sure why Hollywood thinks using the F word over and over is funny. There's no limit, young and old; in a church,; a special moment between father and daughter. I was in a theater where people walked out. I made it through but I was wishing it was over.",0
  Amazing Movie! I honestly liked it more than the first one!,5
  So funny. Even better than the first one. My mom and I will make this movie an annual tradition.,5
  Loved it don?t listen to the reviews awesome movie must see,5
  Worst movie I? have seen in a while. I??be watched cheap porn that was better. Horrible language (even used in church setting),1
  Funny in parts. Story line is very poor. Wouldn't recommend a watch.,1
  Love this sequel- it has comedy and insight if mother-daughter relationship.,5
  Such a disappointment,1
"  How much worse can this get?!? Major stupid, but entertaining.",2
"  I really wanted to like it, but unfortunately it fell way short of expectations, the cast is good but the material and jokes just aren't really that funny.",2
  One of the worst movies of the 2010s. Worthy of a Razzie.,0
  I was worried it wouldn't be as funny as the last one. I mean what could they add? I was worried for nothing. Super funny! It's officially in my top three Christmas movies. It's joining Elf and Christmas Vacation!,4
"  Bad Moms was pretty funny; however, Bad Moms 2 was dreadful. This sequel was a too cheese, too boring, unfunny chick flick - and nothing more.",1
  Long overdue girls night out and I loved the movie. We did not stop laughing throughout the movie. It was not PG but that is what made it great for moms who over the years have watched PG with their kids. It was as funny as the first one and I love how it ended. Wish there were more girls night out movies for those of us who still love to hang out and have drinks with our girlfriends. We went to Cinébistro and it was almost sold out with full bar and food. Great time and great fun.,5
  I? thought it was hilarious but really gross,5
"  Horrible, idiotic and full of unnecessary scenes!!",0
"  It wasnt that bad. It had its dull moments But overall funny, relatable, and enjoyable.",5
"  This movie, with the exception of the ball waxing scene is just not funny. In fact, it is offensive. There is nothing funny about a child throwing around the F*** multiple times. Any moron can say F*** for a laugh. This takes no talent. To teach this to a child is just offensive and wrong.",0
"  Let?s be real, no one is going to see this movie to see a cinematic masterpiece. But it?s entirely on par with the first movie and absolutely hilarious and a really enjoyable movie for a girls date during the holidays!!",5
  A good Christmas film,5
  Loved it... so fun yu see with girlfriends. full of laughs and great ideas. . let's get drunk in a food court!,4
  to me this movie was hilarious and touching at the same time. these 3 along with their cast moms were awesome!,5
  Funnier than the first! Must see,5
"  More accurate film title, ""Bad Moms and everyone involved in this film debases themselves for a paycheck"". Bad as in so bad, it's just bad. Terrible, irredeemable writing. This films idea of moms gone wild is to plumb the depths of obnoxiousness - to have them make the lives of minimum wage mall workers hellish, push over random people, steal others groceries etc. The Grandmothers are so far from reality that they are not even caricatures, they were spawned from another universe. The main catchphrase is ""What the F**K?"", supposedly high comedy when repeated by a 5 year old. The only consolation I have is that by paying to see this, I supported the movie theatre in our small town. Less than zero.",0
  Awesome movie!!!! Love itttt!!!!,5
"  Someone talk me into seeing this movie I wish I hadn't seen it, really horrible if you're looking for a Christmas type show this isn't it. Susan Sarandon's characters called ISIS not funny. Christmas is just a backdrop for this horrible movie.",1
"  I may have given it a 4 and whilst it's not on a level with James Bond, IT, Taken, The Hobbit, Harry Potter etc as movies, the humor is what brings this up. 2017 has me seen Jigsaw, IT, Suburbicon, The Ritual so it was nice to see something on the colorful and comedic side as opposed to a Story or Horror.",4
  Absolutely loved this movie did not stop laughing from the moment it started right up untill till the end,5
  Movies don't get much worse than this one. We walked out less than half-way through due to all the foul language.,1
  Very disappointed sorryTo say... very bad movie shocked that some of the A listStars participated in this movie !,1
  funny. Go see. Don't listen to the critics,5
  This movie was very funny and a lot like real life.,5
  I had the unfortunate opportunity to watch this....,1
  Super funny movie. This is the reason you cant go by movie reviews.,4
"  Great laughs, while not all situations are realistic, it hits on thoughts we all have. F word a tad too much, but who cares.",4
"  If you saw the previews, than you saw the funny moments. This B Moms was not even 1/2 the movie as the first, and does not work as a comedy, zero Christmas qualities, or doesn't even work as a women bonding movie. This one started with a good first 20min, and then just went flat. They tried to use the F word to get laughs, and it loses its shock value in the first scene. Try Thor, 90+ rating, that non comic book fans, and even your female or male date will enjoy. Even if you haven't seen the other two. Sorry bad moms, but when you throw out a sequel in less than a year, than trash is what you get. Hopefully Daddys Home 2 will be a better holiday hit. This first one of the season was bore, that not even the good cast could keep even the women entertained with.",1
"  The word ""Bad"" in the title doesn't cover it. Beyond dreadful.",0
"  Good comedy; has lots of Cussing and inappropriate kid scenes, but is great for Adults!",4
"  not as good as the 1st one (I heard) of course sequels never are, after total outrageous behavior the managed to scrape some moral content at the end, to long, too boring chick flick, insulting to any descent male, save your money or go see something else, scale of 10? barley rates 3.5",2
  The first movie was just supposed to be a stand-alone. Maybe it could have been better if they had thought of a different plot.,1
  Sexy Santa #2 and Kenny G saved this movie,2
  The Bad Moms crew does it again!! It's hilarious and so fantastic because it's so believable and relatable. They truest understand the plight of motherhood and do an excellent job of portraying the challenges and the beauty that leads up to one day. Love love love!,5
"  Disappointing - there's definitely some laughs - mostly later in the film, but this film wastes most of the good will built up from the first film by the time the moms decide to take Christmas back.",2
"  Bad just got worse. This pathetic excuse to get money from your wallet is another way to celebrate the holidays and despite the attention it gets, A Bad Moms Christmas doesn't literally deserve to be watched where it would be both be a waste of time and money.",2
  Will not watch! In these shitty movies they always show the men as retarded and can't do shit for themselves. Plus they show all the women as successful and the Little's girls are always suppose to be way smarter than the young boys! This is all horse shit! Dumbass liberal media and films!,0
  Wow no reviewers saw it the day it came out...is it really that bad,0
  the first one was better but this one was hilarious,4
"  Grade: FRating: R, 1 hour 44 minutes of tortureIn a Nutshell: It's bad. There are moms. And it's Christmas.I'm a mom, but CLEARLY I'm not the target audience for this trashy attempt at a comedy.""Christmas is, by far, the most stressful time of year for moms,"" explains Mila Kunis' character. Yep. While that's very true, that's no excuse for the horrible behavior these irresponsible, obnoxious, rude moms engage in. Yes, extreme absurdity has long been a formula for comedy, but 80% of the jokes in this sequel are super raunchy, and the other 10% are simply not funny.There's no talk about the true meaning of Christmas. None of the women in this film seem to even know anything about Christ or what kind of behavior He expects from His followers. Uplifting theme: Mother/Daughter relationshipsFamily is most important.Things I liked:Kenny G! Christine Baranski is such a critical, evil mother. She's great in all of her movies and even sings a little in this one.Surprise cameoThings I didn't like:The writing is terrible. None of the characters are capable of uttering a sentence without some kind of profanity in it.Lots of fighting. Why is that funny?Kristen Bell is so talented. Why would she ever want to be in such an awful movie? Oh yeah....money.Kathryn Hahn's character is so foul. Her role was the stand-out in the first Bad Moms movie, so they really went over-the-top with her in this one.Everyone is so critical of everyone else.I hate listening to kids scream and cry in movies.Lots of slow-motion musical montages.These moms sure have a lot of spare time to hang out with each other and get drunk a lot.Instead of the ""feel good"" song at the end, a dirty Santa does a strip tease in front of the entire family.Mila Kunis manages to push out a tear in what is supposed to be the big emotional scene of the movie, but the dialogue was uninspired and droll. Interesting Lines:""It's like a giant stress ball from Christmas to New Years."" - Amy (Mila Kunis)""Trust me. Some day she will thank me in an inspirational speech in some large, public venue."" - Amy's mother (Christine Baranski) I laughed out loud at that line, because I think every mother secretly has the same wish. Tips for parents: About 45,362 F-bombs. Even an adorable little girl uses it. Other profanity and extremely crude language. LOTS and LOTS of talk of sex, as well as imitating sex with clothes on.Moms smoke marijuana.Women kissing women.The moms commit various crimes.A bunch of Santa Clauses strip on a stage.Nude man on a waxing table (private parts hidden). MOVIE REVIEW MOM@trinaboice",0
  Boring with a few laughs,1
"  When Bad Moms was released last year, it shattered the conventional wisdom towards target audience. Women over the age of 30 have been largely neglected by film studios in favor of young men. They simply didn't believe women would turn out for a movie that appeals to them, and Bad Moms prove them wrong. Inevitably, Hollywood had to churn out a sequel, but the new Bad Moms movie seems rushed, and it suffers because of it.There's only a year between these two movies, and that goes a long way towards explaining why this movie seems rushed. Because of that, many of the elements the first movie got right. On the technical side, failures like with lighting and song selection are barely noticeable in comparison to the narrative. It's not necessarily a bad thing that two men have been writing and directing these movies. To their credit, they pulled off a real hit with Bad Moms, but with the sequel, their shortcomings in portraying motherhood are apparent. This time around, it feels like they copy and pasted a script from a sitcom holiday special, relying on absurdity, hyperbole, and caricature. It's familiar and tiring because we've all watched this movie for free on television every year.The only thing A Bad Moms Christmas has to offer over those sitcom specials is a return to its characters. Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, and Kathryn Hahn are back, and now their they're joined by they're characters' own mothers. Each of the stars bring their own comedic tone with them that complement, rather than compete with each other. That's fantastic, because while some moviegoers love Kathryn Hahn's raunchy shtick, I've never been a fan of that kind of humor no matter which movie it's in, so its great to have breaks from it. Even though the mothers have exaggerated personality traits, they do make good foils for their daughters, and it gives a good glimpse into how the main characters became the mothers that they are. Those are all very interesting elements, but unfortunately they don't make up for the glaring flaws. If only the filmmakers were given more time, maybe A Bad Moms Christmas would have turned out better.",2
"  Sad to say, the critics were mostly right. If I wasn't retired and hadn't used my $5 AMC reward, I would be really upset at having wasted a couple of hours that I'll never get back. i liked the first movie more than I thought I would, so I was hoping the critics were just being, well, overly critical. But no...At one point I was actually embarrassed for Justin Hartley and Kathryn Hahn because their scene was so cringe-worthy. Don't waste your time or money.",1
  Clearly Gay Men haven't been reviewing this movie...this is sooo much better than the reviews would suggest!,4
  Really Funny!! Recommended,4
  I loved it I thought it was hilarious I highly recommend!,5
  Very funny. I am a hard person to make laugh but I loved this movie. Some weird parts but it didn't decrease my rating.,5
"  This movie was awesome, extremely funny but not recommended for kids.",5
"  Well, Kathryn Hahn makes everything O.K...",2
  When actresses willingly participate in schlock like this I cringe.,1
"  I was really looking forward to this movie and was disappointed. Some funny parts, some silly, some touching, some disturbing and insensitive. At least twice that I noted Christine Baranski?s character referenced ?the Jews? and no one called her out on it, not even an eye roll. Plus was it necessary for Susan Sarandon?s character to be called Isis? Not funny, definitely not cool! So I?m going with the critics on this one.",2
"  If you liked Bad Moms, I am sure you will love this sequel! It is a feel good comedy. The story line may be a little unoriginal and critics are quick to say that the movie sucks but the truth is, this movie is a funny escape from reality. In a world where we are surrounded by negativity and bad news, this movie provided a funny and enjoyable distraction.",5
"  Not many laughs. Very formula driven. R rated because of a bunch of F bombs. Mostly stupid. My wife, who saw Bad moms 1, loved it. I thought it was stupid. Wait for it to be on HBO.",2
  I thought it was a perfectly good movie! I mean not as good as the original but what movie is? You critics seriously need to get over yourselves!!!!!!!! Stop trash talking a movie just cause it's not the funniest movie you've ever seen! It's supposed to be stupid! You stupid critics did it to the hangover trilogy too. Good movies! Maybe you're the ones that are terrible and boring!,4
  Surprisingly good. Only problem is I feel bad for the married guy. The old Santa got more action than he did from his wife. I'm a guy and both my wife and I found this movie better than the first.,4
  Not as funny as the first one.,2
"  People keep saying it's a bad film but it is a good funny comedy with a cast that goes perfectly with the characters, I think it's not as good as Bad Moms but it is still good. Plus Susan Sarandon is amazing at her job so to play the baddest mom but the funniest is great.",2
"  Fun movie with good jokes. It does have a life lesson, but it's not pushed so hard that overpowers the comedy.",4
  Mindless fun. Had quite a few laughs. The movie was worth the admission price.,4
"  Loved it. I?m a mom. I?m convinced the people giving it bad reviews are either offended by the raunchy talk and scenes, or just never been a mother.",5
  Family really enjoyed this movie and wasn't sure if it was going to be that great but I sure was wrong.,4
  It's SO bad. I LOVE raunchy comedies and this was just god awful. I want those two hours of my life back.,2
"  If they actually wanted till December, it would have made more sense",1
  ONE OF THE MOST HILARIOUS TNINGS I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!,4
  This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a very long time. The raunchy humor was pathetic and I am surprised to see so many big name actors appeared in it. Don?t waste your money!,1
  Too much unnecessary sexual innuendo. Too many ?F? bombs. But the message wasn?t bad.,2
  Not the best movie ever but hilarious and a good movie,4
"  So it's just as crude as the first one, but Christine Baranski is amazing at every role she plays and Kathryn Hahn completely steals the movie.",4
  I thought Carol Burnett s character is very harsh and mean spirited and a racist to & on Christmas really wow,2
"  I'm a mom, I thought it was super funny! No one needs to pretend this movie is going up for any Oscars...it's some great actors, having fun for our entertainment! Go see it with the girls and have a freaking cocktail:)",4
  Laugh out loud from start to finish!,4
  I was so excited for this movie and it was such a huge disappointment. Not funny at all. I feel like if you've seen the previews you've seen the whole movie.,1
  My Ten word movie review verdict: Bad moms 2 v The witches of Eastwick 2 anyone!?...Cringefest.,2
"  Some funny parts, but overall a poorly written cliche filled script.",2
"  This movie is about as useless as a movie can beNothing is worth seeing in it. Filthy trash is all it is,I got my money back from the movie box office it was so bad.",0
  I thought the movie was outrageously funny the entire theater was packed and laughing from beginning to end. It?s off-the-wall comedy and it?s raunchy but that?s what I expected from this movie. I don?t understand the negative reviews.,5
"  Mila Mila Mila! Honey, I know you have That 70's Show spark in there somewhere!",0
  An INCREDIBLE movie! You will love this movie! It is a refreshing style of comedy with a perfect cast. What a load of bs reviews. If you don't like hilarious movies or extremely talented women then don't watch movies with all of the above! I hope all of these misplaced reviews don't stop amazing comedies that deal with women issues from being made. An absolutely spot on performance by all actors!,5
  absolutely hysterical!!! just as good as the 1st!,5
"  Cannot begin to express how disappointing this movie is. What a waste of perfectly good talent, just never comes together. The previews are very deceptive as every hint of a laugh was there, nothing extra in the film and even those scenes, in context, are not so funny.",1
"  I wouldn?t even call this a comedy. It was more like a really bad Hallmark Christmas movie. The first one was so funny, and then this was just plain awful.",0
  This movie was just as good as the one before. Raunchy and fun but still with a little heart. May not be the best movie ever but it offers many laugh out loud moments.,4
  crap garbage don't waste your time! it SUCKED!!!!!!!!!!!,1
  It?s a great movie if you?re having a party where everyone is drunk and you need something on your tv. I?d love my money back if possible.,0
  It was just as funny as the first one! Laughed all the way through this! Hope they do another one.,5
  Would rather watch Krampus again than this pile of trash,0
"  Bad Moms is a national treasure and should be cherished within all of our hearts. The fact that we were blessed with a second installment, and even better yet, a Christmas special, is a glorious honour. 5 STARS",5
"  I'm embarrassed that I stayed in the theater to watch this movie. As a mom of young amateur actresses, I would NEVER have let my daughters be in this movie. The first few scenes, as other reviewers had said, has a young girl taking the Lord's name in vain after an expletive. I was very offended. Parts of it were funny. Parts of it were just downright raunchy and others offensive. I wouldn't recommend that anyone go see this movie. I offer an analogy that I once read. If you make a nice meal but then put dog Crap in it, the whole meal is inedible. I don't understand why the people involved in the writing and production of this movie have to use a whole bunch of dog crap AND be offensive.",1
"  If you can get over yourself and see the movie for what it is, you'll find a hilarious fun movie.",4
  They missed the opportunity to make it a great franchise,1
"  Moments of the movie left, wondering why they needed a sequel, but then the cast showed you exactly why you needed to see these Current day moms!",5
  Thought this movie was hilarious. Just as funny as the first one. The whole theatre was laughing out loud.,5
"  dreadful, worst movie i ever saw. not funny and tried too hard to be with gross, contrived, unoriginal humor - script the worst. like a 5 year old wrote it.",1
  I have had it with these monkey fighting bad chick movies on this Monday to Friday Hollywood office of the directors!,0
"  Hilarious! Great stereotypes, characters and script if u need a laugh this is for u!",5
  Who in the Writing Dept of the 1st film had the idea to rush a Christmas Sequel out of this? Waste of time and money.Hope they dont make a Xmas sequel of Girls Trip.,2
"  Totally ridiculous, not worth the time spent viewing.",0
  VERY FUNNY ! MUST WATCH !,5
  This movie was hilarious!! It's a must see!!,5
  So so stupid. There are just no words. An embarrassment for all of these actresses.,1
  Cheesy and over acted,2
  Not as good as the first. First 20 minutes I said to myself this if the worst movie I?ve ever seen. Some laughs thanks to Baranski and Hahn. Mila Kunis was super annoying.,2
  Very few funny jokes but for some reason I didn?t hate this movie. I just disliked it,2
"  Really horrible, OMG. Seriously, do filmmakers REALLY believe we do not need actual WRITERS these days? The first Bad Moms was actually much better, had some kind of real story. This is just Older Moms vs. Younger Moms, with lots of dick jokes thrown in, haha just hilarious (NOT). After the film (and I almost fell asleep a couple of times, it was that meaningless) I tried to remember ONE scene I thought was truly funny or heartwarming or silly/joyous. Couldn't think of ONE. I'd like my money back, please. And my time.",0
  Enjoyed the first film but there was a spark missing in this sequel. Rent it on DVD.,2
"  Loved it! Maybe not as much as the original, but I thought it was super fun and right on point!",5
  Laughed all the way through this movie! A great show!!!,4
  Just so so bad... such a shame because the cast is awesome. I can?t believe how bad the writing and plot are! It?s that bad... how could these actors even agree to this? Shame.,0
"  So much talent gone to waste. How many times do you need to hear a ten year girl say ""oh my f@cking God?"" Sad way to start the Holiday Season, with this crap.",1
"  Funny film, we Loved it",5
"  A handful of funny moments, but mostly just over the top crude and extremely depressing. Not funny, hopefully they learn from this and the third one will resemble the first and be hilarious. Two thumbs down on Bad Moms 2",0
"  Pretty bad movie. But, it had its laughs! It's rare that I go to see a generic comedy, but I wanted to laugh",2
"  Wasn't any good at all, it was really bad",1
"  This is such a great ""girls night out"" movie! About 10 of us went to see it last night and it was hilarious. The movie is ridiculous, of course, but it gave us a ton of laughs in so many scenes because they were so absurd. If you are looking for a few laughs out with the gals, this is perfect!",4
"  I am the target demographic of this movie. Myself and 11 mom friends went to see this. It was hilarious - lots of cursing, off color jokes and sexual innuendos.It was better than the first movie. Would see it again, great fun.",5
  good movie with lots of laughs,4
  This movie was so bad I left after sitting there for less than an hour. There was no need for a sequel and obviously no desire for one as evidenced by the poor writing. I laughed maybe 2 times and snickered about the same. For this to be a movie about family and Christmas these 3 'moms' spent a whole lot of time hanging out with each other drinking instead of spending time with their children...during CHRISTMAS!?! I loved the first one as much as I loathe this one. Don't waste your money or your time.,0
  This movie was hilarious. Really funny- especially for a sequel. Really well cast. Highly recommend for a fun night out!,5
"  I liked it.It wasn't as funny as the first film, but it still held my attention and kept me happy and entertained.",4
"  My wife and I walked out halfway through this movie. It was a white and unfunny version of Girl's Trip. Not saying that it was unfunny because there were mainly white people in it (Bridesmaids was hilarious). I'm just saying this movie had raunchy, Girl's Trip humor without the laughs. I think I laughed more during Schindler's List that's how unfunny this movie was. It sure tried to be funny, though...maybe a little too hard.",0
"  A Bad Moms Christmas: In this sequel to 2016's very funny and charming Bad Moms, Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn decide to ""take Christmas back"" when THEIR moms (Christine Baranski, Cheryl Hines and Susan Sarandon) arrive for Christmas. What made the original ""Mean Girls for Mommies"" so fun was the spot on casting, realistic, heartwarming and hilariously raunchy story. This time, sadly, we have none of that. The script is exceptionally weak, the jokes painfully corny and tastelessly crude (with the exception of Hines, who slays as the clingy mom) and, until the finale, completely lacking heart. This sequel is as bad as the original was good. Bah humbug. D",1
"  Quite a pleasant surprise to be honest. Similar to the first, everyone's entitled to an opinion so if you enjoyed first I think you'll like this one too.",4
  Must see ????????????,5
"  While this sequel isn't completely devoid of funny moments, it is a big step down from its predecessor. I think most of the comedy in this movie is in the first half and it is very hit and miss. I found myself either chuckling or just uncomfortable in scenes and there wasn't much in between. I liked the characters in the first and I still found them likable here. The new cast is also enjoyable. The actors do what they can with a weak and very predictable story. The story is so by the numbers that the dramatic moments don't really land either. There are a few laughs here and there, but as a whole, I would recommend just watching the first movie again, this one just falls really flat. ",2
"  A Bad Moms Christmas is one of the worst, most disgusting, horrid, misogynistic (you'd have to hate women to write a script like this one), movies of the century. Any hopes I had that it might be funny and in bad taste like the first one, were dashed within the first five minutes. Maybe three decent one liners, many scenes of children using profanity, children being subjected to hard core mature sexual innuendo and humor...one hope it dies a quick box office death.",1
"  Amusing, sometimes funny but not that good overall.I was bored in places, it wasn?t as good as the first one. Not much plot to this one.At least one of Mila Kunnis? parents in the movie should have had the same ethnic origin as her.",2
"  Did not even chuckle. Over an hour of bad crude ""jokes"" with no real storyline. Characters come on screen, say something offensive then move off screen to allow another character to follow suit. Should have watched Thor again instead",0
  This was painful. How did ebert give it 3 stars? I think his finger slipped. At some point during this crap show I started having trouble sitting in my chair and staying there. The grandma plot line was just so...dumb . And it ended as if there would be a 'bad grandma's' movie and I am not going to see that...even with moviepass. Do not see this in theaters. Wait till you can be at home and doing 12 other things,2
  i loved both parts so funny and refreshing,5
"  A nice little surprise two summers ago was the movie Bad Moms. It was a funny little comedy that had some good laughs. So in normal Hollywood fashion, a sequel was quickly made and it isn't good. Any time a movie needs 6-7 music montages during the film, you know it isn't good. If it wasn't for Kathryn Hahn, this movie might be the worst of the year. She at least has a few good lines and so does Christine Baranski. I mean some of the scenarios in this thing are so unrealistic, it just sapped the fun away from me. I know I can be hard on some of the 'chick flicks', but even my wife wasn't too crazy about this one. Ladies, maybe you will need an outlet while us dudes are checking out Thor this week, but you can do better.",1
"  I loved it, laughed so hard right out of the gate. It was almost better than the first",4
  Horrible sequel to a thoughtless original,0
"  It had some laughs, but it wasn't great. It's not as good as Office Christmas Party (which was only a little better).",2
"  I wanted to walk out of the theater after the first 20 minutes. I hated this movie so much. So much swearing the entire time for no reason. In the first Bad Moms I laughed, but this one didn't get one laugh out of me. There was zero chemistry between cast. The script is just atrocious. Completely unfunny and forceful.",0
  It is a laughing until you hurt good time. Not for those easily offended. Still had a great message for all Moms. If you are a pretentious asshole and think all movies have to be deep and meaningful - DON'T GO! if you want to have a great time and are too hard on yourself as Mom - GO SEE IT.,5
"  Very funny. The original cast members continue in the humorous and raw spirit of the first. And the new cast members, their moms, give us insight as to where they came from.",4
"  mostly terrible, but still watchable with some laughs. Ladies will enjoy the stripper,Justin Hartley, who has a nice part with some great dance moves.(John Cena would have been good too; wonder if he was under consideration). The visiting Moms got on my nerves after a while. Movie felt very ""forced"" and most laughs were quiet ones. Only 8 people in the theater.",2
"  I don't know how this movie cost $28 million? The actresses must of stolen all the budget money. Its a terrible easy scripted movie that anybody could of written this themselves, the acting was awful, the jokes were so cheap, there was really no special location worth saying they needed ex money for a film set some where expensive, it was made in a low budget neighborhood probably grandma's house or something. Seriously these are the kinda of movie's that are made to paid the greedy actors to feed us lousy movie's so they can profit on something that does nobody any good accept the movie producer, actors, the agents, the Weinsteins - crap to us movie goers to give us no nothing entertainment. Its a waste of time, production, peoples time etc to fill the movie theaters so these greedy actors can take our money for something worthless like this. This is nothing but a bad stupid movie and to think there are people behind the set in this movie that made a few million each to feed their glamorous lifestyles to hard working Americans to pay for this crap.",0
  very few funny parts,2
"  It was funny and raunchy. I like the franchise, I think it's close to corny but it steers clear and remains on the humorous side. Best thing is how true these story lines are haha, most parents would love to act like these moms!",4
"  A rare case of the sequel passing up the original. The movie was a laugh riot from start to finish with sequences as memorable as those found in other modern comedy classics such as ""The Hangover"". Raunchy, funny, heartwarming, and an instant dark holiday favorite. Also, a big nod to Kathryn Hahn, who absolutely steals the show in every scene she's in.",5
  worst movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ladys cant act in this movie also shut up meg,0
"  Revolting nonsense - typical Hollywood profane, over-sexualized potty humor supposed to be hilarious because ""women can be vulgar too!"" Wow so empowering. In the first 5 minutes a 7 year old is pretending to ""unknowingly"" mock an orgasm repeating OMFG pounding the table. Downhill from there. Propaganda disguised as liberation. Dear Hollywood your movies suck and I want all of my money back.",1
  A pleasant holiday surprise. Casting is key to what makes this movie work. If you're looking for silly fun then this is your movie.,4
"  Hysterical, laughed the entire time. Sequel is better than the 1st!",5
"  Over the top crude, predictable, and not at all funny humour. Forced ourselves to watch 40 minutes hoping it would get better, and then left.",0
  Went to an advance screening. It was a bit raunchy and hilarious. Whole audience was laughing throughout the movie.,5
  much better than the first...hysterical,5
"  If you?re feeling sick and need to throw up then this movie is for you! It is stupid, and vulgar! Definitely a candidate for most stupid-movie of the year! Waste of time, money and brain cells! If I could rate it minus 4 I would!",1
"  No rotten tomatoes rating yet?,,bad sign!",1
"  Why are Mila Kunis' - who is of Ukrainian Jewish heritage - parents northern European in this movie? Why can't her parents be more realistic? Hollywood, you suck!",0
  can't wait to see it,5
"  The first one was surprisingly good, so why not?",0
"  Hot garbage for the Holidays season, I'd rather get a lump of coal rather than see this again.",1
  Saw a special screening last night - so funny!!,5
"  My stomach hurt I laughed so much. It is as good, if not better than the first one. The theater was cracking up the whole time.",5
"  This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It felt like the original script was aiming for a PG-13 movie, but desided to go for an R rating last minute just by adding a few hundred F-bombs. The problem wasn't the swearing, but an extremely over use just to cover up unfunny jokes. On top of all that, the film creators added corny and cliché music to all the bad jokes. It ended up just annoying me. Save your time and money, this one deserves a negative score.",1
  I went to a presceening of this movie. It is hilarious and in my opinion is funnier than the first one.,5
  loved this movie. had me laughing for a good chuck of the movie. loved it!,5
  So funny. We loved it!!!,5
  Fun sequel. The older cast worked out well as family members. Mommy issues galore!,2
  So I guess we're making this a franchise now ?,0
  please and thank you make this movie cheaper,5
  I thought she he first one was ok and it was good enough to make me want to see this movie. Looks funnier than the first one.,0
  i wnat to see it sooo bad,5
"  It's certainly not the traditional King Arthur story-- It's more like a King-Arthur-flavored action flick. Enjoyable, absolutely, but not if you're expecting ""the Sword in the Stone"" meets ""Le Morte d'Arthur"" or accurate Dark Ages history.",4
  Movie critics do a disservice to people. This movie gets rated 30% I'd have given it 80/90%. Your opinions are not shared and are often opposing the view of the general public.,5
  Very good and very well done. Be a damn shame if there isn't a sequel.,5
"  I hate that Rotten Tomatoes ruined any chance of sequel for this movie. If you like Guy Ritchie films, you will love this movie. His style of directing and camera angles are among some of my favorites, he used some techniques from Sherlock Holmes, but gave it a different twist, and it's amazing! I love the story, it is of course not 100% with the original story, but it's a good one. It hits all the main topics, and Ritchie adds in his own flavor. I love Charlie Hunnam, and it sucks that he hasn't had good luck with movies, because I think he's a great actor, and it's a shame that this stupid website ruined the chances of this, because a sequel could have been EPIC!! Stupid Rotten Tomatoes. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!! You won't be disappointed, and if you are, you probably don't like Guy Ritchie, Charlie Hunnam, or not big on sword fighting.",5
"  A new outlook on an otherwise old and over-chewed story. For anyone who wants the original story, they can pick up a book.",5
"  The movie starts out interestingly enough but as in most movies made buy directors with an unlimited budget, they lack the ability to end the movie with finesse and logic. The ending is a smothering of special effects that are all over the place and make no sense. This will work well for a 5 year old audience with limited cognitive abilities. Why tell a story then end the story with whatever pops in your mind. Were the producers on ecstasy and molly when they were writing the screenplay? Probably. Re-write the ending and make it a little more along the story line of King Arthur and it wouldn't be such a overcooked mess of dung. Give me the reins (a complete amateur) next time so it will make sense and be memorable. I promise not to trip on acid when I'm writing the ending. Holy Sh#+!",1
"  Very underrated entertainment and wonderful updated story. Great, cleverly nuanced dialogue and fierce action scenes. Personally, I thought the cast was wonderful and exceedingly watchable.",5
"  Absolutely LOVED Guy Ritchie's fantastical epic tale about one of my most beloved British legendary heroes, King Arthur! How could the critics have gotten this one sooo wrong? Hugely entertaining with a stellar cast portraying engaging characters and amazing storytelling I throughly enjoyed this modern snapshot of how King Arthur rose to the throne. I've seen this movie several times and I am never disappointed... The soundtrack is mesmerizing, sets the tone, and underpins the action perfectly. I only hope there is a sequel!",5
"  The opening sequence is truly beautiful. A well crafted world that draws you in. Music that fits the world and arouses emotion. It has really good cinematography in the parts that matter, such as where excalibur being used, the sequence with the lady of the lake, the king displaying his absolute authority, and many, many more. They managed to create a narrative that encompasses a lot of the Arthurian mythos we love while blending it with a romantic English atmosphere. The combat sequences in the latter part of the movie before the climax could have been done better, but all in all, for a 2 hour movie, it does a great job at keeping your attention. I would have liked to see Charlie Hunnam give a speech to the people, either at the beginning when he's almost executed, or at the end at his coronation, but his performance was otherwise stellar. I appreciated the cast enormously. Eric Bana, whom we know from Troy, plays Uther. I also liked the inclusion of Katie McGrath, who played Morgana in the TV series Merlin, though I wish she would have had a bigger role. It would have been good to see Merlin and a bit more of Arthur's character. I felt that they concentrated too much in that one scene where Uther dies, though I suppose that without it the movie wouldn't make too much sense. However, I wish I would have seen a bit more of who Arthur is. And more than that, where the sword came from. After all, you'd think that with a title like that, the origins of the blade would have played a bigger role. All in all, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword will surely go down as the best modern rendition of Arthurian legend, at least for us viewers.",5
  Not sure why this movie got such low ratings. It was spectacular! Especially in 3d. The story line was engaging and the characters were relatable. The action scenes were off the chain. I feel sorry for anyone who didn't see this movie,5
"  One of the most underrated movies of all time. So disappointing that this franchise did not get the opportunity to continue the full vision of this Masterpiece. Very few movies can I watch again and again With continued entertainment on Steroids. If you haven?t seen the film, please Watch and Post a review. The movie is even better on a second or third viewing. The director has melted past, present and future in this fast paced exposé. From well developed characters,Strategic editing, Great acting, and a Captivating script this movie proves to be nothing short of Brilliant!!",5
"  I absolutely love Kig Arthur : Legend of the Sword. The acting is wonderful and King Arthur ( Charles Hunnan) and The Mage ( Astrid Berges Frisbey are a fantastic team. She is French and I believe he is from Australia. Love them both.The supporting actors were fantastic as well. THE STORY. WOW. Whomever wrote, directed and starred in this movie should be awarded the Acadamy Award, that is how much I love this movie. Let' us not forget Jude Law who plays the part of an evil King with powers given to him by the dark side who is represented my very large snake creature. This creature is hideous and beautiful but very evil just the same. Jude Law played his part with such perfection that it is possible that you may hate him after seeing this movie. Remember people, only the character he plays is evil, not him.  I taped in on my DVR just by accident but I will tell you, it was the best accident that has ever happened to me.  Rent the Movie ! You will be fascinated, angry, sad, happy and all the emotions these wonderful actors bring you through. Watch it at least two times so you don't miss a thing.  I heard there is a follow up movie and I will be waiting. Love to All, Cathy. catshabay",5
"  I loved this movie. it had flaws, but overall a really great story, full of heart and warrior energy. i'm glad i finally saw it.",4
"  You guys got it wrong...this is a great movie. Just the right balance of mystic and natural laws, innocence and evil, action and dialogue. Charlie Hunnam was perfect as was the sound track. I would have it on a loop if I had a copy.",5
  Its a great movie and i really can't unterstand why this movie got that rating!,4
"  Even though King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword failed to deliver at box offices everyone who took the time to actually watch the movie enjoyed it! I for one was extremely excited about the idea of making a King Arthur series and I would have watched every installment. The acting was solid, even though there were some small plot holes the plot was still strong and resonated with the audience very well. Overall this movie is extremely underrated and I believe it deserves a sequel!",4
  I absolutely loved it,5
  I do not know what people have got wrong about this movie.... it is AMAZING¡. Best magic and modern writing I have seen to date. Please make parts to and three.,5
  Great movie...Critics are idiots,5
  HEll of a fast moving screenplay and amazing acting. Rotten tomatoes are rotten. Do not believe their 30% rating! Top class direction and visual effects i watched in a long time.,5
  breath of fresh air with all the crap that is being made recently,5
"  I have watched it several times, thought the sound track wonderful.",5
  I felt I had to review this movie cause of its low ratings.,5
"  This is an awesome movie from a regular person!! The acting was off the charts, music couldn't have been better in scenes, action/generated scenes were entertaining keeping you on the edge of what's next, and my favorite parts are the comedy which literally make you LOL to say the least! I give this movie 5 stars for the simple fact it never gets old. I've watched this on and off about 7 times now :)!!!! So to these stuffy critics please don't listen they wouldn't know a good movie if it smacked them in the face apparently! Thank you to the director for a great movie to watch, not many you can watch over and over!!",5
"  KING ARTHUR Legend of the Sword is the most rewatchable movie since Kill Bill volume 1. I actually disliked it the first time I watched it. It seemed choppy, and I had difficulty following it. The second time it came into focus, and now I see it as a perfect movie, so different from what you would expect from one of the oldest stories. Music is awesome, the roles well acted, and the build up to the climax action/excalibur/good vs evil/ and payback is just perfect. I really hope that Guy Ritchie does at least one more. I think it will catch on.",5
"  Would have been an awesome film if the fantasy elements had been a bit more coherent, and if we cared about the characters a bit more. Jude Law was really quite good in his role, but again ... much more could have been done with his character had the producers been willing to sacrifice ""blockbuster"" action sequences for better, lengthier character building scenes.",4
  One of the best movies...sadly it is underrated,5
"  A cliched ""chosen one"" fantasy tale with all the predictable story beats.",2
  Stellar acting from both Hunnam and Law. The music adds a much needed modern touch to this medieval tale.,4
  Definitely worth watching it...,4
"  I am not sure why people hated on this movie so much, I honestly enjoyed it.",4
"  The film presents an amazing, action packed, and epic story that recreates the legendary tale of king Arther in the best way. The music is exiting, the characters are likable, and the crew and cast are perfect for this incredible movie.",5
"  Way better than criticism. Amazing cgi and cinematography, a different telling than your average King Arthur story and great actors. Another movie assisnated by out of touch critics.",5
  It was beautiful and interesting! The special effects also amazing!,5
  Probably one of the better stories about King Arthur i've seen. Good action with a descriptive back story and some awesome magic.,5
"  It's not meant to be an in-depth story, we all know King Arthur, Merlin, Camelot, but what we never see is some pretty sick action scenes and just a gritty telling of Arthur and his rise. This short version is fun, action packed and just an overall good fantasy movie. If you watch it thinking about the story of Arthur and the knights of the round, you might not like it, so just sit down open your mind and watch a cool movie about swords and magic.",4
  Great film it was different recommended to watch,5
"  I found Guy Ritchies' version of King Arthur refreshing, entertaining and enjoyable. Really enjoyed it. If you want the old fashioned, boring versions of King Arthur, then this films not for you. Let's remember that King Arthur is a myth not a fact and therefore, open for creative license and personal interpretation. Something I think Guy Ritchie has done very well in this film. Charlie Hunnam was a good choice for Arthur. I recommend this film, but please don't watch it with a preset idea of how King Arthur should be.",0
  i have nothing to say,5
"  The movie, although lacked a sense in legitimacy, was cleverly done in my opinion. King Arthur was action packed and full of great cinematic shots throughout. Definitely one of Guy Richie's better works.",4
"  Excellent movie, powerful sound track/music, great acting, gripping storyline, creative plot, captivating CGI. Loved it in the cinema, almost as much enjoyment in the lounge room a year later.",5
"  Can't believe critics scorned this movie! I loved it! I may not watch it again, but it was a fast paced mivie.Beautiful scenery, great fight scenes, Jude Law and Guy Ritchie! Lots of fun to watch!",5
"  The movie was poorly made. I feel that they could've done better. The story was confusing, but over all I think the movie is a 7/10.",2
"  A game cast and a worthy aesthetic idea are buried under some of the most grating editing, abusive visuals, and irritating music I've ever seen/heard. Guy Ritchie stretches his familiar ""quirks"" into full-force fuel, providing a movie with no sense, and no Merlin.",1
"  Guy Ritchie is a master story teller. He really uses visuals in this film to draw you in. This is truly an origin story, well told and the beginning of an epic journey - if it hadn't been cut terribly short by a poor performance in the box office. Some of the characters in the story did not necessarily get the screen time they needed in order to be developed, but the reason is that the King Arthur film was meant to be several films long, which would have allowed ample time for every character to be fine tuned and experience a full character arc. I wish I had the privelege of seeing a sequel, but I know that it will never happen. Hats off to Guy Ritchie for taking another famous tale and recreating it in his visually thrilling style of filmmaking.",4
"  Wow, I was blown away. The fact that this movie is bombing is already making me sad there will probably be no sequels.An incredibly original take on the Arthur legend. A fun, dynamic story structure. Snappy and engaging editing that keeps it all going in a fresh pace that subverts expectations. A brave embrace of magic and fantasy.This movie doesn't waste time on things we've all seen a hundred times. It takes elements such as a character growing up and turns it into a creatively done little segment that gives us the necessary information we need, and does it all in a very concise and quick way. By doing so it leaves more room for new things we haven't seen before.This movie could've gone down a path everybody's too familiar with, but it smartly didn't. Instead it did something new and fresh.The dialogue told us everything we needed to know without becoming boring or too expository. It got straight to the point, sometimes in an almost 4th wall breaking manner. It kept me engaged and wondering what will come next.In one scene Arthur stands in line to try and claim Excalibur, and you'd expect him to just wait for his turn, but then the movie just decides that we're not seriously going to wait for him to get his turn, so Arthur just bypasses everybody and just fucking gets on with it. It was a neat moment that captures the whole vibe of this movie.The visuals were all perfectly fine, and sometimes they were more than that, they were great. Thrilling and breathtaking. Exciting.The art direction of this movie was on point, the style was slick and the movie's very own. The soundtrack was incredible, it just hit all the right notes and moved elegantly along with what was seen on screen. It was epic, moving, and blood pumping. Pretty memorable.And of course the actions scenes. Smooth, beautiful, a lavish spectacle. They were honestly a joy to watch. Felt adventurous.Now, the movie did have some missteps. Some flashbacks were used too much, the third act becomes a bit more predictable than I'd like, and generally felt a bit flatter than the earlier two acts. But even then I was still enjoying it and appreciating it for the spectacle.This movie establishes a wonderful world that I wish we get to explore more sometime in the future. It sparked my imagination and was a very pleasant surprise. An experience I don't regret in the slightest.This is a rare case where you really should go see it for yourself before you let something like a bad Rotten Tomatoes score define for you.",4
  I love the sense of humor in this film,5
"  I've watched it multiple times. Every time, it's as good as the first!",5
  I loved this movie and people are crazy to not give it 100%ratings what's not to love about this movie it had a lot of awesome actors and actresses! This movie was awesome! I hope to see another on soon !!!!!,5
"  I actually liked the film. I think Charlie Hunnam, was a good choice for Arthur. It was a fresh updated story with a good cast of characters that interact well together.",0
  I absolutely loved this movie! I can't stop watching it! If you go by the ratings and not by your own opinion you are going to miss out on an amazing movie. I loved the cast and the incredible computer graphics. I am seriously hoping that the follow through with making the rest of them. I am so glad that I never go by ratings when I pick movies to watch because this one rocked! I also really loved the sound track and as soon as I find it I will be buying it.,5
"  A very enjoyable Richie take on the plentifully told story, not failing to provide fresh flavor while not compromising on the fast paced story telling Guy fans won't be disappointed with.",5
  The book is one of my favorite fantasy classics of all-time. The movie on the other hand is not good at all. Terrible dialogue and the cinematography is sketchy. This adaptation of the great King Arther novel will want to be forgotten amongst its fans.,1
"  Hate critics... this movie was AMAZING. If you're looking for a shakespearean, boring, dialogue filled movie, this is not it. This is my first review, and I'm writing it to counter the haters. THANK YOU GUY RITCHIE!",5
"  the movie was a lot better than I thought it would be,",4
"  to start I did like this film when it started, but that is about it the longer I watched the sooner I wanted it to end, the story telling was bad, the villain was nothing, and the thing I hated the most was the music score, it did not suit the film. on a good note Eric Bana was good.",2
"  It was just the amazing, exciting movie. I do not even want to say anything about the critics who evaluate each film differently and not objectively (some films are praised for one, others blame it for the same). It is a great pity that the film failed.By the way, the film has great assessments of both people and critics in our country (IN THE CIS)P.S. Excuse me for my english, it is not my native language.",5
"  In the same way that THE WALKING DEAD has pocketed the zombie genre, the epicness of GAME OF THRONES has made it a lost-cause to try and amuse present-day medieval / fantasy film admirers with just a two-hour legend movie. Just as I speculated, KING ARTHUR supports my statement above, by cause of a satisfactory plot that's been polished over with dull themes, outdated special effects, uninteresting characters, and an ending that I've already forgotten.",2
  Fun loving Guy Ritchie take on the old tale and a killer soundtrack. some slow parts to complete the story but all round enjoyable and some sweet CGI,4
"  This movie is very untrue to the original legend of King Arthur. I mean sure there are some elements keep the same, but it's highly westernized. And very well at that. It lights a spark that wasn't there until, know to draw in new audiences. Also the protagonists charismatic character only helps this, as well as some amazing directing sequences. It's very entertaining, very well paced. This new approach on the Legends of the Sword is also welcomed and makes this not that cliche. Very well acted, and shot. A very good movie. Definitely worth a watch!",4
"  Is a movie of guy ritchie, if what it is!",5
  Great movie and really saddens me that there will not be a sequal this was a fresh take on the story and the type of movie is what the move industry needs its gritty and badass and a change from the over saturation of super hero movies at the moment,5
"  This movie kicks some serious ass, I just have to say. I really don't understand why it has such a low rating (29% as of this writing). In fact, the low rating almost prevented me from watching at all, but I'm a King Arthur nut so I had to give it a chance. Boy am I glad I did. It's really different and really fun. A total guy's movie, but I like that too. I can't stress enough, do not be turned off by the low rating here. This movie is sweet, you won't regret watching.",4
"  Really liked the movie, feels like more of its own story over the King Arthur legend.",4
"  The movie got me thrilled, action packed classic knight battle is what we want, i am aware of the classic story but the styling of this classing is not a bit lame, King Arthur is yet a fiction so it can be twisted and nothing shown in the picture is bad. If i say the timing the movie toom was too long for the graphics it contains. At a time it begins to look like game. I add that the story was good and Hunnan was the best character i saw fit for Arthur, as for the Merlin series, i found it lame and the cast was lame too.Although this movie lacks big star cast and female roles it made a good play. And if i suggest that if the movie was not named arthur then it would have earned more than it did for now. I loved it, way better than the captin america series.I only wish to see the other next parts. And most importantly the movie should have been definitely be publicized more and for a new comer the release date should have been different and less crowded. Keeping all this in mind it was supposed to be the top earner.It was a good work Guy Richie, appreciate it.",4
"  The worst movie of 2017. No women in it to relate to and the ones that are in it, are in a pretty white dress and get killed as a sacrifice! TOO MUCH CGI. Also the modern twist didn't work. Don't watch.",0
"  Saw this multiple times in the theater and bought it as soon as it was available. I'd watch it again on the big screen if I could. The soundtrack is phenomenal and really pulls you into the movie. The pace of story telling and mix of humor with action make this a great flick. I definitely recommend it. Some King Arthur purest seem to have a problem with it, but, I for one hope Guy Ritchie can pull together enough interest to fund a sequel.",4
  This is a must buy movie-- just downloaded it! Done very well-- justice to the King Arthur story.,5
"  The reviews does this movie no justice, but it's still just another generic blockbuster.",2
  Surprisingly good! Was not sure at first I'd like the pacing and how there was some shifts from the basic legends but I really liked it and I'm sad they're not going to make more.,5
"  A chap who isn't quite Jason Stathem but feels his spirit can be summoned set of with some mates to knock over a 90s red postal transit van, in pursuit of some presumably lucratively Jiffy bags.

  Loved the mash up of video game style fighting sequence with the movie. I really wish the 6 movie franchise would happen!!,5
  Brilliant film making. Excellent Guy Ritchie finesse and perfect performances from the two male leads... Loved this movie,4
"  A phenomenal and original retelling of the Arthur. I am astounded that the critics killed this inventive, Intelligent, thought-provoking, and thoroughly entertaining movie with their negative reviews. But, remnember, these are the same critics who gave ""wonder woman"" , a below average lackluster effort, high marks. The period costumes are remarkable, the sets are strikingly authentic, and the score is pounding and hypnotic. Charlie Hunnam is well cast, and Jude law makes up for a multitude of prior C grade movies with the best performance of his career.",5
  Phenomenal. Truly beautiful. It's Art!,5
"  I watched this on cable and can't figure how why it was received so poorly. Our entire house enjoyed the story and the effects were pretty awesome. I did have a little trouble understanding accents but was able to put on CC, maybe that was the difference. I would certainly watch it again, plus the music is AMAZING! Don't read all of the bad reviews and give it a chance.",4
  the best movie i have ever seen in my life and will contiune to be the best forever,5
"  Surprisingly enjoyable, fast-paced, and decently acted - but badly timed. We've been hit by a storm of GoT inspired fantasy that's left us all tired of swords and witches.",4
"  Not as good as people say. Some good parts, but mostly just slow drama.",1
"  I don't care what the dang critics say, I LOVED this movie. Very sad there won't be more!",5
  This movie was entertaining.,4
"  Ridiculous, unrealistic, terrible waste of two hours.",0
  3D was very well done!,5
"  Watched this 4 times now, a few epically great scenes some, great scenes and the rest very good. I grow tired of watching they same formulaic films this does something different. If you're stuck in a rut and enjoy being stuck in a rut don't bother watching.",5
  I tried to watch it twice and could not finish it.,1
"  It may be a revisionist take in desperate need of further revision, but Ritchie's take on the Arthurian legend still has its moments.",2
"  Surprisingly good, different take on the Legend",4
"  Not the most comprehensive movie of all time, with definite stylistic choices that don't always pay off, still, as a die hard Arthur fan it was really nice to see a movie that wasn't trying to be a gritty retelling of the same story for the thousandth time. Hunnam's Arthur is a damn treat, and the whole cast oozes personality at every silly plot turn. Not a cinematic, dignified masterpiece, but rather a fun, romping reimagining of one of England's oldest myths, Arthur: Legend is absolutely worth seeing.",4
"  This Movie was awesome. Not everyone has the same taste in movies, that's the beauty of it. Many might think it's because Charlie Hunnan was in it but not in my case. More action and drama than romance. I think all the actors did a wonderful Job and Guy Ritchie did a great job Directing and Writing it. #HANDSDOWN #LOVEDIT",5
  What the hell had to turn it off so bad,1
"  A bit mad but a good film - lots of action, some great visuals and decent bad guy.",4
"  Completely lost, and a complete waste of my time. Disappointed!",2
  It was a fun movie. Not too challenging and interesting enough to keep me watching.,4
"  Fantastic watch, amazing music score. Loved it",5
  One of the best movies I have seen this year!,5
  One of the best movies made in the last 5 years! Will watch again and again. Would add more stars if could also love the soundtrack.,0
  Don't listen to the critics this movie was great. The music that they picked to accompany it was unbelievable. We have seen the same story 5 times but Guy Ritchie took an old tale and made it new and exciting to watch.,4
  Probably one of the worst films I have ever seen,0
"  I had never heard of this movie nor had I seen the previews. All I saw was that it was another King Arthur flick that I thought I could fall asleep to. A little more than 2 hours later I'm still up and writing a review. I thought it was a fun, fresh, and adrenaline pumping retelling of the legend. The great action sequences made up for the questionable storyline that is really nothing like that of the classic. If you are expecting the same story you read or watched in the past, you'll either be delightfully surprised by the novel retelling or disappointed. This is not Disney's the Sword in the Stone by a long shot. For me, that was a good thing actually.",4
"  The biggest issue is the editing. The director, in an attempt to make this movie appeal to younger audiences, has the movie edited like a music video. This means that the dialogue is said really quickly and the camera rapidly cuts back and forth between shots. The pacing is also really choppy. Core parts of the story that should be 20 minutes long are only 5 minutes long, thus parts of the story are really rushed. Likewise, other parts of the story could've been shortened. Another issue with the movie is that there are many fantasy elements in the story, like creatures and people with wizardly powers. For example, Arthur's aided by a sorceress while on his journey to claim the throne. These elements are either never explained or explained in a split second. This goes back to the super fast dialogue. You see stuff like giant snakes and elephants and you just have to go with the flow. When watching, it's better not to question certain things that happen on-screen.To be fair, there are many good aspects of King Arthur. The basic plot is easy to understand and there are no subplots or love interests to speak of. The massive budget is put to good use as all the special and visual effects are fantastic. Things like the lighting and setting were well done and all the battles were spectacular. The majority of the film is very entertaining and the actors do fine work. There's just enough character development, so you feel what these characters are going through. In the end, the trailers describes this movie in a nutshell. It's weirdly paced, the dialogue is super fast, and certain areas of the story are rushed. However, it's nonetheless very entertaining and epic in terms of the visuals. I rate this a 50%. I would not recommend seeing this, but if it's a rainy day and you have nothing else to do, watching this wouldn't be a bad idea. As long as you go with the flow and not question some of the fantasy moments, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, is simple fun.",2
  So good. Hope there is a second one,5
  Bad. Acting good in a bad confusing movie.,1
"  Guy Richie is becoming one of my favorite directors. Nice spin on a classic tale, This movie moves fast for the casual film buff, but in reality this movie will go down as a Cult classic... Richie keep the story moving fast, without getting to hung up on being a dull orgin movie, as we have seen multiple times with Spider-Man or the Batman tales. Great acting and cast, Jude Law is always a solid actor, and Charlie Hunnam delivers a great young soon to be king. I am very disappointed in the reviews and the rotten 29%, but like I said, this movie will gather steam and become a cult classic...",4
"  Loved it! I never saw a commercial for this movie or heard of it it at the box office. The critics hated it of course but I was pleasantly surprised by it. I fully recommend watching this movie! My only gripe is that I wish they would have spent more time on his solo journey through the ""Dark Lands"".",4
"  As a fan of both Arthurian lure, and Guy Richie's style I absolutely loved this retelling. I usually do not prefer a CGI-heavy film, however I thought it played well in this. The action moved the well known (and sometimes boring) tale of King Arthur, but not in a way I found to detract from the narrative. I enjoyed this ""before the legend"" version. My only complaint is that I doubt a sequel will ever be made. I had hoped for the Richie take on Merlin.",4
"  This is my favorite movie (period.) I'm not sure what the negative reviews are for. The directing, acting, action, and plot are awesome. Love it!",5
  Charlie Hunnams great but a poor film,2
"  Normally enjoy stories of King Arthur, but this was not that story. While the cast was amazing , the movie was not.",0
"  Not what i expected going in, this movie was a pleasant suprise in a way only Guy Richie could deliver.",5
"  This movie was FANTASTIC! The action, story, special effects were amazing! I don't understand the bad rap this movie has received. See it for yourself and don't ever listen to the critics! Guy Ritchie, as always made one hell of a movie. Keep up the great work Guy Ritchie!!",4
"  OK I was so excited to see a new film about King Arthur as the older Excalibur movie is one of my all time favorites. Let me just say I watch a ton of movies some very bad and yet there is always something that makes me watch to the end. Not this time, this is one of only 3 movies ever I switched off about a third of the way through. The story line made no sense, there was not a single character that I gave a crap about and no mystery as what was going to happen as it just jumped all over the place. Long story short not only a huge disappointment but the worst movie I have tried to watch in a decade.",1
  Don't believe the critics on this one. Entertaining movie well made movie.,4
"  Guy Ritchie as always, a masterful story teller.",4
"  This movie was awesome! Perfect, perfect casting and the bad ass Guy Ritchie style! The trailer did not do this movie justice at all. I've watched it at least 4 times!",4
"  Great movie, with good actions and excellent cinematography!!",5
  Does every major critic works for Disney today? I didn't go to see this at the movies only because of the bad reviews. I watched it the other day on HBO and I enjoyed it. It wasn't great but it was entertaining and I'm watching it again again and over again. In fact I'm buying DVD and Blue Ray. Rotten Tomatoes you are co owned by WB couldn't you help at least one of the brothers out by taking a score a bit higher? I also think we should prohibit hipsters from writing reviews or have any kind of opinion on art. Stick to Wes Anderson boredom.,4
  Incredibly entertaining,5
  This movie captivated me every time I see it and I've watched it several times on HBO now. I wish so much for a prequel with utter pendragon and Merlin. The music definitely captivates and sinks me further into the story. Badass.,4
"  A little a head of its time I think but really well done. I liked the music, effects, and acting. Not sure why it was given such harsh ratings.",5
"  Guy Ritchie kills it with this!!! Great dialogue, action and performances set an amazing picture worth a few sequels.",5
  I was entertained and I'd go see a sequel if they made one.,4
"  I'm not sure why this movie provoked so much ire... I thought it was good and very entertaining. Also, Charlie Hunnam is very watchable.",4
  Reviewers are jerks. This movie was amazing.,5
"  Just watched King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. It was great. My friends and I all agreed and heard great things before. So we are excited. Good movie with a gamer story line/effect that complimented the story line and invokes a fantasy, once upon a time legend for what is good, yet with a tasty edge. We all hope this becomes a series. Noted that, critics these days have a narsist, raised snout toting, need for negative/pessimisism. It's ruining it for the rest of us. So is the need to base movies from the theater response alone. Time for a change. Great Movie. Hope to see more in this, if not like it.",4
  Obviously not the King Arthur I read about as a child but entertaining and well done.,4
"  Surprisingly good, even with some of the anachronisms & Richies signature swagger. It is astonishingly faithful to the source material while feeling free to riff on the myth in fresh ways, & it's a classic example of the hero's journey. Bravo!",5
  Loved it. Beautifully made. They never go in depthwith the sword and its powers in other movies. Didn't think I would like it but I didn't want it to end. Think he wanted to do a trilogy which would have been nice.,5
"  King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is a gritty alternate take on the popular legend. Highlighted with interesting characters, subplots and music that matches the action it deserves a watch if you are a fan of sword and sorcery.",4
"  I waited with glorified anticipation for 2 years for this movie. I LOVE the Arthurian legends and Charlie Hunnam. I watched it once at the theater and twice now on Cable. It doesn't get better. What a disappointment. And Who Makes A King Arthur Movie Without Merlin???? What a waste. Sad. Someday someone will make a wonderful movie about this Classic, but this is too abstract and off the original story.",1
"  If you like action, you love this movie. It's definitely not boring and I love the style. It's different from any other King Arther movie I've seen, and I love the fresh take on it.",5
  don't understand critics. I thought the movie was pretty damn good.,0
  One of the best movies of the year and it breaks my heart that it's done so poorly in box office and critically. Hopefully will be well remembered in future and become a cult classic.,5
"  Whoof - what a dog of a movie. I flipped to HBO and this was on, I wish it wasn't. I thought I was watching a preview for a new show but no, that's how they filmed the movie. A bunch of disjointed segments with no flow - camera shots that cut away every 4-5 seconds for the hole movie with an ominous sound effects that would make you think you're watching a preview. The only thing missing from this montage mashup of a movie was Joe Esposito's 'You're The Best Around' song from Karate Kid playing in the background.",0
  Awful. Do not waste your time on this utter garbage.,0
  This movie was typical Guy Ritchie style of gritty action with a twist...PERFECT!!! Terrific cut action sequences and brilliant casting. Really enjoyed this film!,5
"  A complete non-sense, senseless editing, vomit inducing camera moves, laughable dialogue, the worst movie I saw in 2017.",1
"  Not the best movie in the world, and not the best storyline, but overall entertaining and worth a watch",4
  watched it drunk & really enjoyed.,4
"  I loved this movie. This is exactly why I try never to read reviews. It was a modern twist on King Arthur and I am bummed that they will probably not make a sequel on account of ""reviews"".",5
"  This is a movie you just have to see and can't go by the railings. It is a new action filled spin on a classic tale. Charlie is amazing as always. If you have not given this movie a go yet, give it a try and make up your own mind. I really hope they make a sequel guarantee it will do better in theaters not that more people have seen it and apperciate it. I did not see it in theaters after watching it I really wish I would have.",5
"  King Arthur is one of my favorite stories since I saw Excalibur as a kid. I've watched just about every King Arthur movie or tv show in the past 30 years. I liked this movie because I know the story so well it was kind of cool to see it in a different perspective. This is definitely a Guy Ritchie film, which I also happen to love. If you liked Snatched or Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels then you will like this movie.",4
  Amazing movie. Loved it.,5
"  Thought it was great , story telling like the movie snatch , with 300 type action and excellent characters",4
"  Harmless fun. Not sure what the hate on this particular film is...I have seen a lot, lot worse. Granted the budget is astronomical and this should have been a 60-80m film.The beginning and the end are the weakest elements with a lot of CGI inserted in.The film picks up when we meet Arthur, the heir to the throne. Operating as small time crook with a heart of gold and a cheeky cockney grin. The film keeps it all lighthearted and fun and for a different take on the Arthur legend it's not bad, not great but honestly I have seen a lot worse turn a profit and get a let off.",2
"  Gave up after fifteen minutes; an attempted mash-up of a LOTR ripoff and an ""Excalibur"" ripoff. Just awful!",0
"  One of those examples of a movie that gets so much right - and what it gets right is SO good (great costume design and visual effects) -, but still gets overlong, exhausting and dull. It is just busy/noisy/imaginative enough to distract you from the drab storytelling core. It moves fast, which hides its lack of drama - there's no tension here, just lots of stuff happening. It's as though Guy Ritchie binge-watched Game of Thrones and then thought to himself, ""Hey, I can do that!"" To which I reply, ""No, Guy. No you can't."" Astonishingly, this film was originally conceived as being the first part of a potential six-film franchise, though I have serious doubts that it will do well enough to rate even a second installment. It's a mess graced by a few terrific sequences, but a mess nonetheless.",2
  This movie was awesome. Charlie Hunnam was awesome. There was not one dull moment and the story was great. Special effects was the best. A must see movie.,5
"  After attempting to sit through many renditions on the big screen and small, I have finally found one that lives up to it's title.",4
  I would like to have seen more of the dark lands but the movie was awesome!!!! I recommend watching it,5
"  What a mess. The story is all over the place, the acting is needlessly over the top, and completely unnecessary special effects (elephants as big as mountains?). Don't waste your time.",0
"  A terrible film and a complete waste of time. The first 15 minutes gives the film a death sentence when you have giant mountain sized Mastodons. Must have been written by computer geeks with a "" oh lets put this in and then this because it is cool"" attitude...",0
"  So glad I finally got to see this movie! I waited for it to come on cable because I read the bad reviews, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! now I wish I would've seen it in the big screen! Charlie is always easy on the eyes and made a perfect King Arthur! I loved the effects and the magic of the storytelling.",5
"  In his 2017 film ""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"", Guy Ritchie attempts to raise the proverbial sword from stone by reviving both the ancient tale and Jude Law's career. The original score by Daniel Pemberton was, by far the most memorable quality of the film and the only reason 4 stars instead of 3 were given.Overall, didn't make me walk away.",4
  That is now one of my favourite movies!!,4
  Very entertaining. Great mix of one liner humor and solid battle scenes. It left me wanting more. All characters worked well together.,5
"  Watch this this weekend, on HBO, if you like Guy Ritchie films, watch this and if you like it, rate it at Rotten Tomato and IMDB",5
  Def solid action flick. Watch again.,4
"  This film looks great with strong visual effects and cinematography, but the direction is completely off. It seems like far too large a film for Guy Ritchie, with some of the scenes pulled straight from some of his earlier films such as ""Snatch"" and ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". The dialogue is also off and is a weird mix of modern language and classic speak. The actors are okay and do their best with what they have to work with. It's long and boring and not very appealing.",1
"  An overcrowded cast, choppy plot and video game level action drag the promising re-imagining of King Arthur down.",1
"  These days have been a bit of a movie marathon with the kids being here since the 24th so we have made quite a dent in the to-watch shelf of my movie collection.Yesterday it was time for some rehashing of the Pendragonian legends in the form of King Arthur: The Legend of the Sword. Usually I find it dangerous business to mess with classical and well proven stories. Do not fix what is not broken and all that. I did, however, find this rehash quite entertaining.The base of the story is of course, and thankfully, the same: Uther is killed, Excalibur ends up in a stone, Arthur pulls Excalibur out of the stone, lots of swordfights, Arthur becomes king. The details of that story is rehashed quite a lot though.The movie opens up with some fairly cool action where Uther combats Mordred (yes Mordred already in the opening scenes, as I said, rehash...) who attacks Camelot with black magic and king-sized (pun intended) combat elephants. I cannot say too much about what happens without spoiling a lot but the sword ends up in the stone and Arthur ends up...somewhere else.So already from the start the movie asserted two things, that it is a different take on the Pendragon saga and that it is fairly heavy on action, black magic and special effects. I was a bit worried about the rehashing of the saga bit at this point but, as you have already deduced from the above, overall I quite enjoyed the movie.The movie proceeds by showing us Arthur growing up in a bit more misery than the traditional stories do but it does so in more or less fast forward mode and we arrive rather quickly to the point were Arthur pulls out the sword from the stone.This is were I have a bit of a gripe with the movie. This moment felt a bit anticlimactic and even disappointing. There was not big moment of awe just confusion. As the movie blurb hints at, Arthur is neither ready nor willing to become a king. So at this point everyone has to go through the hassle of convincing him. I rarely like this reluctant hero concept. Boring!Luckily Arthur has a merry band of friends to help him chose the right path and this is were the movie spends quite a bit of time. With Arthur as a bit of a Robin Hood in the woods and him and his compadres nibbling at Vortigern's heels. Of course every so often Arthur is nudged towards his destiny and the action when he decides, well is forced is perhaps more correct, to pick up Excalibur it becomes a bit of an FX feast.In terms of acting and characters I would say that they all made a fairly good job of it. Arthur himself is stuck with the reluctant hero role, which I am not too found of as I wrote before, but he is doing a decent enough job of it. Vortigern is not bad as the chief bad guy. I did like the mage although most of the time she was looking into the distance and flapping her eyelids. That is when things were happening though. You do NOT want this gal to flip her eyelids at you!Naturally everything was slowly building up towards the big bada boum between Arthur and Vortigern and, again, I think this was fairly well done. Lots of action, lots of magic and lots of FX. I really enjoyed how things played out at the end and all the visuals. One thing that I did like more with this version of the story, okay bit of a spoiler ahead, is that it did not end as tragically as the usual King Arthur story.Bottom line, if you are set in stone as to what the Pendragon saga should be then watch another movie. If not and you're up for some nice fantasy action adventure in the Pendragon universe you might like this movie. I did!P.S.The ""critics"" at RT sucks as usual!",4
"  I can't even begin to list all the ways this movie sucked. The few slightly promising elements, such as the development of the friends who would eventually become the Knights of the Round Table, or some of the more obscure parts of Arthurian legend making it into the film (e.g. the stone being the body of Arthur's father), get hidden under a steaming pile of shit which they've tried to make look pretty with way to much visual effects. I pity the actors for not having the opportunity to show their acting skills (and for having this on their resume). Usually I can ignore the crappiest plot if the fight scenes are good but these were just a guy running along swinging his sword at people who couldn't fight him. *yawn* I'm gonna go watch paint dry now.",1
"  This is one of the worst movies I have seen in the last 10 years, and without a doubt thé worst movie in the Arthurian genre. The authors may as well have chosen non-Arthurian names, it wouldn't have made much difference to the story. The story itself is so weak that it is practically nonexistent, and otherwise nonsensical, the acting is absolutely terrible, the director an outright idiot. There are some good special effects in there, but they don't make up for everything else that is a failure. It's a waste of money to see this movie, and it was a waste of money to make it. Do everyone a favor and leave this total failure at this, don't make a sequel because no serious movie fan would care to see it.",0
"  I bet you didn't realize your life was missing a retelling of the Arthurian Legend in the style of Snatch, but by golly, you are. And it's pretty amazing. Ritchie's unique style is on display to full effect here and it is one of the best takes on the legend in recent years.",5
  Great movie don't ever listen to rotten tomatoes smh,4
  Incredible movie! Guy Ritchie's approach is extremely interesting in both narrative and visual! A film that certainly deserves attention for the bold choices of direction taken. It is not always that we see a block buster perform so many trials! Commendable! It makes me have a great time!,5
"  His best work was indie, these blockbuster movies just seem to get away from him.",1
  Really enjoyed it was funny but to the point at the same time and action scenes for fighting.,4
"  Great film, don't think the critics know a good film when they see one!",5
"  King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is a 2017 epic-fantasy based on the infamous legend of King Arthur written and directed by Guy Ritchie and stars Charlie Hunnam, Jude Law, Àstrid Bergès-Frisby, Djimon Hounsou, Aiden Gillen and Eric Bana. When Vortigern (Jude Law) betrays his brother King Uther (Eric Bana) and orchestrates a coup to rule of Camelot, a baby Arthur is smuggled to raised in the streets and Londiniun, As the child grows up, he becomes a skilled fighter (Charlie Hunnam) and crosses paths with King Vortigern's minions to which he gets imprisoned and becomes an immediate threat once he pulls the legendary sword of Excalibur from stone. A band of rebels of Uther's former general Sir Bedivere (Djimon Houson), assassin Sir William Wilson and a Mage (Àstrid Bergès-Frisby) help Arthur to guide him on the path of self-discovery and to start the fight for the rule of Camelot and freedom of men with assistance of mages and armies becomes an epic legend. The most refreshing about this movie is the take on the infamous Arthurian Legends and energetic modern direction that Guy Ritchie brings in to any movie. The ""Richiesms"" in the movie are abundantly clear as he presents frantically fast-paced action, rock-style and very witty approach similar to his style in Sherlock Holmes movies makes the movie fun, exciting and refreshingly new. Not many people may appreciate this style as most are used to see the legend in a certain context, so the movie does become style-over-plot and may be perceived negatively. If there is one thing that adds so much energy to the movie, it's got to be the soundtrack. Daniel Pemberton, highly influenced by Hans Zimmer, adds so much epic-ness music for certain scenes that keeps the audience pumped and in-tune with the events. When it comes to performances, ironically it is the secondary characters that get all the positive. Jude Law is brilliant as the conniving and evil Vortigern. Eric Bana's performance, although brief, adds solid weight to the character and more ""gravitas"" to the movie as whole. the french actress Àstrid Bergès-Frisby plays mysteriously as the Mage and Aiden Gillen has a similar, good performance to that in Game of Thrones.  Where the movie fails is in the main protagonist's performance of Hunnam. He doesn't give enough believable performance of the legendary character and seemed like a regular man whose not filling the right shoes of a larger-than-life character. Another negative point was the editing. The movie feels as if it was a 3 hour movie but significantly got cut into 2 hours. The third act suffers from the full-blown CGI dilemma that most Hollywood productions are well-known for, and becomes more video-game looking than a movie. Overall, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, is genuinely a highly-energetic new take on an old legend, that deserves the opportunity to strike magic. King Arthur: Legend of the Sword gets a B-.",4
  I can't believe this movie was so poorly reviewed by the critics. It is not supposed to be a historical portrayal. It's Guy Ritchie's own spin and it's a good one. Charlie Hunnam is spectacular as well. Plays the role spot on.,5
  Loved the movie in the theater and have since purchased the DVD and watch it quite often. I am disappointed there will be no sequel. Our entrie family enjoyed the movie very much.,5
"  For many movies, the viewing environment can drastically affect your perspective and ultimate assessment of your enjoyment of the film. When I was just about to become a teenager, I used to take the subway into Manhattan to go to several of the myriads of low-cost theaters located within a few blocks. This tendency for solitary viewing has carried over through my life long attachment for the cinema. Now, when I receive a new movie to preview my first exposure is during a quiet evening accompanied by only a pad and pen to jot down a few notes. There is an understandable exception to this sweeping generation, and the latest flick on the docket required hanging out with my best friend to create an atmosphere most conducive to the best way to fairly consider my impression of the movie. The film submitted for consideration was 'King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword.' Cutting directly to the chase the ensuing two hours and six minutes became the home version of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Unfortunately, our comments and jocular observations being a better source of entertainment than the actual movie. Ultimately, my final ranking came across slightly elevated than if I had followed my usual practice of a solitary viewing. Throughout the history of film, the Arthurian legend of brave knights, Camelot and striving for a better way to rule. There have been treatments of this story have been done from the perspective of the youthful exuberance leading to the round table, the weary older versions of the principle cast during the decline of dream and even a Broadway musical that was a hit on both stage and screen. Most of the standard plot devices and archetypes regarded as necessary for a successful project are ingrained in the foundation of this story including romance, combat, magic and one of the oldest of all themes, sibling rivalry. It requires the participation of many in the cast and crew to achieve this dubious goal but this movie is the epitome, or perhaps better stated as the nadir if anti-synergism were the total work is less than the sum of its parts.It is an excepted directorial style to bring the audience into the middle of the story, in medias res. It is considered an advanced technique requiring a considerable amount of expertise, experience, and talent. In this movie the director, Guy Ritchie is a name that is highly recognizable with a substantial fan base. However, this does not confer the proper bona fides on the auteur that would have permitted him to navigate the intricacies required successfully. His forte is predominantly brute force urban violence typically in London or another UK metropolitan area. The cockney accents are so realistically thought that English subtitles are typically necessary. This story set in the barbaric era of sub-Roman Britain circa early in the twelfth century. The dialogue is nearly indecipherable in what I have dubbed 'Middle Cockney.' To the detriment of any in the audience with real intentions of following a storyline, no subtitles were provided. When combined with an almost complete lack of any explanation, exposition or context. The version I was provided was in 3D, so I was hopeful of at least some noteworthy cinematography and imagery. This optimistic anticipation was depressed some when I noticed the Director of Photography was listed as Daniel Pemberton, a man whose work in movies was nearly entirely devoted to musical composition.The initial battle is led by the good king of Britain, Uther Pendragon (Eric Bana). His opponent in this mortal combat is the evil wizard, Mordred. Clad in the standardized fantasy rendition of ancient armor it looks as if the producers managed to pick up the metallic costume at Peter Jackson's post-Lord of the Rings yard sale. The battle is to determine the fate of humanity through the magical power of practitioners known as Mages. The king is victorious but is soon betrayed and murdered by his brother Vortigern (Jude Law), who usurps the throne. In the confusion of the coup, the royal prince and true heir to the throne are spirited away. In the darkest part of Londinium he his brought to a brothel raised by the prostitutes that name him Arthur. His childhood is mostly running cons on the street frequently rewarded by the men working in and near the house of ill repute. Arthur (eventually portrayed by Charlie Hunnam), diligently the by hordes the coins until by the time he reaches his majority he has accumulated a substantial chest of gold. His experiences provide him with street smarts, ingenuity, quick reflexes, strength, and stamina. The turning point of the story, or at least what is intended to pass as a story, is when a group of Vikings led by Greybeard (Mikael Persbrandt), mistreats one of the young ladies Arthur and his friends Tristan (Kingsley Ben-Adir) and Backpack (Neil Maskell). They are subdued and captured by the 'Blacklegs,' Vortigern's minions a general jackboot henchmen. The three are captured, added to a contingent of prospective slaves. As part of the induction process Arthur is placed in line with hundreds of other young men. The routine is to attempt to pull a magic sword from an enchanted stone. Everyone tries an fails moving on to the next station where they are branded as property. Arthur is anxious for his turn, pushing to the head of the line. Grabbing the hilt, it begins to move, and in a flood of visions, it comes free as Arthur passes out.Infused throughout the movie the dialogue, quickly becomes evident that there is no doubt that the man in the commanding chair is none other than Guy Ritchie. His directorial trademarks include intensely violent urban crime thrillers. As alluded to above his penchant for exceptionally thick Cockney accents makes following the dialogue nearly impossible except for the men and women occupying the areas I London represents the Vox popular, my jocular reference that the characters here spoke 'middle Cockney' was intended as descriptive more than satiric. Supplanting the requisite chase scene through the narrow back alleys and streets of London are replaced by the same hyperkinetic mayhem transposed chronologically to Londinium, a settlement preceding the modern city. The choice of location does permit the realization of a famous nursery rhyme line 'London bridge is falling' albeit resulting from a conflagration. If it wasn't for the conspicuous period costumes, the movie could very well be any of Mr. Ritchie's other offerings. This filmmaker is deservedly well considered within his genre of expertise, but he is out of his element helming a fantasy/supernatural action flick such as this.The overutilization of modern tropes, techniques and plot contrivances admittedly project a certain campy quality but barely sufficient to support the majority of the story. The inclusion of archetypes typically associated with modern times is so out of place in this setting that the overall effect is disconcertingly out of place. One of the most glaring examples is an attack on the royal pretender, Vortigern. The plot involved an archer in assassinating the king at an impossible distance. The sniper was played by an actor who has recently become synonymous with treacherous, covert plots, Aidan Gillen. In this story he plays archer extraordinaire, Sir William ""Goosefat Bill"" Wilson. He is highly recognizable as the Machiavellian most of Westeros, Lord Petyr ""Littlefinger"" Baelish. No matter what remarks may be applied to this movie it has an incredible cast with highly talented and seasoned performers in every role. This initiated a chase through the busy streets cluttered with tradespeople and surfs. The Blackleg soldiers brutally mow down anyone getting in their ways prompting my friend to note ""#surf lives matter"". This is such a typical scene for any film by Mr. Ritchie that his storyboards could have been from any of his flicks.The reliance on the supernatural that had been made indispensable to achieve the dénouement is so far out of the filmmaker's comfort zone that it comes across as little more than bad swords and sorcery made for TV movie. The actors are professionals doing their best to give their fans a commendable performance, but it is a decidedly an uphill battle neigh on impossible to overcome. Within the last few scenes of the story, there are a considerable number of loose ends and traditional aspects of the Arthurian legend that the best friends of now King Arthur are duly knighted, and a large round table is uncovered. It appeared that the studio demand the production completed, the conclusion left things open for a sequel but considering the estimated budget of $175,000,000 resulting in a domestic box office gross of just over $40 million. We may be spared the second act. The 3D effects are about average for an action film with a few ingenious effects to spice up an otherwise by the numbers production.",2
"  if you like the style, you'll enjoy the twisted story and visual performance",4
"  Best damn Arthur movie out there, especially if it's the Otherworldly aspects of the legend that fascinate you more than the political conflict. If you're inclined to esoteric interests, this is the Arthur movie you've been waiting for.",5
"  This movie is on tacitly a pickle. Aside from some podcasting though, there are some really strong and interesting themes in this movie. It is a shame that the director wasn't a little braver and didn't keep going back to his safety net all the time.",2
  Medieval based Snatch that's feels like being a kid watching a friend playing a speedrun through a video game,4
  Another movie which RT says is crap that is actually entertaining and not another camelot drivel .. it is getting to the point that if RT critics say it is crap it is a damn good movie,5
"  What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said before. Well for starters, most films tend to have a promising start before either falling into mediocrity or rising to greatness. However, from the get go this film was just a confusing mess of CGI with absolutely no plot what-so-ever and they just continued to roll with this mess all the way through. I can understand trying to reinvent King Arthur for the modern audience, but not THIS way! The film was the worst kind of boring too, it was a boring without personality to boot. If this was to be the start of a franchise, then this so-called runner not only stumbled out the gate, it did a messy bone-breaking tumble before falling off a cliff into an ocean of sharks!PS. If you do want one positive from me - I liked the look of post-Roman Londinium. But it can't decide if it is a film that is in or out of history. If you're in post-Roman Britain, make it look that way. Not Dark Age people running around in Lord of the Rings-esque plate armour! Oh damn, I turned the positive into another negative.",1
  Forget the critics on this one. This was an amazing movie and it's a fun watch.,5
  I think this movie is pretty good.i recommend it a lot.5 stars!,5
  very well done! enjoyed the different perspective and the special effects were excellent!,5
  Not sure why it flopped so badly at the box office. I thought it was really good.,5
  a great balance of entertainment,5
  Brilliant and sorely underrated by the official critics.,5
  I love Arthurian Legend !! This cast was fabulous ! Thoroughly enjoyed this film !,5
  What an awesome take on a medieval classic. Guy Ritchie's style has been perfectly interwoven into a story that has been told so many times to create a new twist and hopefully series.,1
  if you really want to be bored to death by a movie this is the one for you,1
"  (5.0 out of 6)When we see what powers others possess that are far greater then ours, we see our power lies within our own mind when we see who holds power to only take it down and the rest will follow. When what others can't see coming others use their power against those who have blind hearts, to betray them. When not seeing eye to eye on what we see, when our powers are only meant to be used for peace, while others rather use for dominance & control. When the only remaining power we see we need to protect we can't possess to only let go. When we see that we come from powerless places to only use the little power we have to get more power when surviving & adapting to what only sees power as an asset we need to use to our advantage to get stronger. When what other powers we possess reveal powers that are hidden from sight to see for us in what we don't see when power is located in rhelms we can't be when we rule here on earth. When what powers wish to be seen, it reveals themselves when it see other powers rising awaiting its return. When what others can't see where powers are held, they are used to make a profit & start a livelihood. When what keeps us living, we protect when we only see our power can be used to fight. When we don't see who we deal with when they are protected by those with greater power, we see some fights we can't win.When some powers we use to serve when we see others have powers that go beyond human powers to only obide. When what powers threaten us we see we must hide, but don't see how powerful others are when they are everywhere. When what others wish to possess they hold only for those who can unlock its power when it's passed down and chosen for us to follow, a powerful destiny to lead. When what others can't see, the power overwhelms them when we never felt such power before. When what others can only see that can hold such power we possess. When we see where such power was hidden from us all this time, when the vary power could have been in our place holding to our power, to imagine what power could have been. When what we wish not to see when such power now can overthrow us, we see to kill. When what others can't see when powers are hidden from our sight, we see are on our side. When we are powerless to defend those from harm to only give up ourself when our we have a power for good. When we don't see hidden powers that lurk when they too await the day for others to return when some powers is only meant to be held by those good. When what power others think we want to possess we don't want, when we see what power can do to a man that makes them less of it. When what we try to make others see in what they come to see is the powers they don't have within them that is hope and the powers others have in them that is not destiny. When what others are loyal to their power is only to protect what is rightfully theirs. When what others swore to protect their powers can go as afar enough to those who want it. When we refuse to see what we don't want to see it is revealed to us what powers were taken from others forged in stone so others deserving can hold, when some powers are strong but not strong enough to unlock without the right key to open it. When what 1 power isn't enough to defeat another power, others join powers to see they forge a greater power. When what we don't see, it is revealed when seeing somethings is important when we have to show what dark powers others are capable of. When what others refuse to live under such powers when they are dishonorable, or are ruthless, we see the little powers others have can be put to good use to convince. When what powers others continue to grow in numbers, we try to limit when some powers are not meant to grow longer and stronger when it's dark. When what powers lie far away we plan where we will be where we are when overthrowing some powers requires a firm grip on our objective when they get away from us when we least expect it. When what little power we have we out run and fight when we don't see victory anyother way. When what power we possess we make sure we see have a firm grip on what we hold when it's the only thing that we have a chance in victory. When what we wish for some powers to end, we see what deep within sees and what our power sees, we must defend someplaces from holding such powers. When we know what it is like to feel powerless to know power only causes death, that we don't want any part of. When we have yet to see what will happen if others hold power, to see we were given such power for a reason to prevent what we see from happening when it is disaster. When what others see, they know they are seeing right when some powers have returned to only forge themselves along their side when the time comes. When we have yet to see what potential our power holds when we can hold power and power can hold us to know we have no control over what we see and do when we wish to retain it at any cost. When we see what we hold in power, power wishes us to hold, when it's vary power gets stronger in what threatens it to know we either feed into it or embody it when power forges itself within you. When we see such powers comes at many costs to only go where all lives lost go powerless when some powers are meant to be taken down. When some powers start somewhere to see what such places are meant to hold power for its people. When we don't see what makes such places legendary, to see those who ruled, and what they hold to know such places were powerful because of the power they held in a sword.",4
  Some good action sequences and effects but the movie suffers from rather juvenile story tricks or dialogues or mythical connections every now and then.,2
  So what's wrong with the critics? seriously! they gave this movie those low reviews... unbelievable,5
"  nice update to an dramatic folklaw/historical/myth of the Pendragon family entrusted linniage, to be the bearer of an enchanted sword.liked it, good, could not falt really",4
"  This film was awesome and very epic. King Arthur legend of the sword was a good film and it was very different take of story of King Arthur but it managed to pull it off. Very artistic and the visuals were very good not like ghost in the shell that has very awesome and beautiful visuals, but it was good and very historical telling the story of legendary King of England. Well done guy Richie you yet again made a awesome and epic film about the legend King Arthur in a very different and good telling of the story. Well done love the film awesome.",5
"  far the best movie I've seen in the last five years. The negative reviews from critics only shores up in my mind that the movie industry belives only mind-numbing, cookie-cutter story lines bring in dough. I am saddened that the critics may win and we will not see any more installments of King Authur.",5
  This movie was absolutely amazing!!! The graphics were out of this world! The story line was true to fable! I couldn't take my eyes off the screen!,5
  Not sure how this movie was not given more attention. Great story and acting! I've seen it again and again!!,5
"  what's not to love? minimal dialogue, moments of joy and a fair amount of dramatic edge.. loved it :)",5
  i liked the witty dialogue and jokes and the action was heaps good,4
"  King Arthur Legend of the Sword is a fast paced, non stop action packed adventure!",4
"  Bad CGI, a complete disregard for source material, and a needlessly complicated story ruined this for me. That being said, all the actors definitely were trying.",1
  Magnificent! Loved it. Screw the critics.,4
"  Jude is a fantastic bad guy... loved the camera shots, music and actors. The banter between characters is funny and whitty....",5
"  Jarring, disjointed, and terribly disloyal to Arthurian canon, this movie had a great opportunity to renew and reinvent a classic tale that was sadly lost in poor pacing and storytelling.",1
"  From Guy Ritchie comes a bold new vision of Arthurian lore, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. After growing up as an orphan on the streets Arthur discovers that he's the son of the slain king and must reclaim the throne from his treacherous uncle who uses dark magic to rule. Starring Charlie Hunnam, Jude Law, Djimon Hounsou, and Eric Bana, the cast is pretty strong. And Ritchie's unique directing and visual style brigs a lot of energy and excitement to the film. The action scenes in particular are especially well-done, and are enhanced by the incredibly intense and evocative score. A gritty dark fantasy, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword presents this classic myth in a new light.",4
  Full of nonstop action and yet somehow so boring it was an effort to keep watching.,1
"  This movie was just something i will never forget in my entire life, it was something really special it got me into a lot of thinking. Still i find it really sad how it has such bad critics, and then again critics like ""there werent a lot of women"" just makes a lot of the bad critics jokes. I have to say the movie is great do not believe the other critics it is worth watching three times which I did and I still have feelings to go again and watch it!",0
  The cast is the only saving grace for this film. Everything else is just meh. This movie is your typical Hollywood blockbuster that was over advertised and meets up to approximately zero of the hype.,2
  King Arthur: Legend of bullshit.,2
"  A visual spectacle which is as aesthetically heavy as it is tonally uneven, King Arthur wasn't as bad as I'd heard, but wasn't especially good either. I love Guy Ritchie's early films, namely Lock, Stock and Snatch, films which have kinetic energy, memorable characters and sharp, witty dialogue. Unfortunately, trying to apply the Ritchie tropes to the Arthurian legend, and giving it a distinctly modern feel when it comes to the screenplay, doesn't work to the films advantage. You never get the sense that you're watching famous medieval figures, just modern individuals cosplaying as famous medieval characters. The story is a mess, the characters largely forgettable, the dialogue anachronistic and rarely funny and the actions sequences are such a waste of time and effort. I don't know who it is that keeps informing Hollywood directors that viewing audiences want fight scenes where they can't actually see or comprehend, but they really need to stop. The camera never stops moving and swoops and swings all over the place when a slower, steadier directorial style would capture much more of the action, and therefore make it more exciting. It doesn't help that they're also edited into oblivion, with nary a shot going past a few seconds. It pulls all kinds of hackneyed narrative tricks to keep the plot going or kickstart the proceedings. There's at least 3 scenes where Arthur wakes up from a traumatic dream containing story-related information, and many more instance where he simply obtains what he needs through visions or premonitions. I did enjoy some parts of it, but it never adds up to a whole experience, and it's depressingly obvious that they were angling for a franchise to spring out of it. Unfortunately, with the pittance it made at the box office, we may never see that come to fruition.",2
  I can?t believe the same critics who gave the most rubbish movie ?Wonder woman? excellent critics so underrated this super movie. Is the political and gender correctness all that matters these days???,5
"  So good, I'm hoping there is a sequel!! A must see!",5
  What a wonderful movie. The cinematography was amazing. The environment was lush or desolate but always beautiful. The acting was superb and the cast was wonderful. The story and how it was edited to move it along and keep you on your seat the entire movie was amazing.Akin to Game of Thrones and touting a few of its veteran cast as well if you're a fan of that series but won't miss the nudity watch this movie.I have no idea why rotten tomatoes or anyone else would give this a less than good review because the reasons given are embarrassing and seem to be lies.What a wonderful movie. My girlfriend and I agreed wholeheartedly.,5
  I read as King Arthur as I could get my hands on as a kid. I don't recall him being a Kung-Fu master.,1
"  I'm actually surprised by the low ratings and low box office turn out for this movie. Critics say it ""piles mounds of modern action flash""....ya and don't other action films like Fast and Furious and Marvel franchises do the same?? That's what people want to see when going to an action flick. Also to say that it ""wipes out much of what made it a classic story in the first place"" is probably written by someone who is banking on the fact that most people reading the review actually haven't read Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur (which I assume is the source referred to in the ""classic story"" premise). In my opinion, and not that it matters much, this particular version is actually a more close adaptation of portions of Malory's work than say....the Kiera Knightley version of King Arthur, First Knight or most other adaptations. While I did enjoy both movies mentioned above, I just think there might have been some other motivation for reviewers to warn movie goers away from this film. I guess all one needs to do is look at the discrepancy between the critic review and the audience score to see that critics are part of the Hollywood core that is disconnected from most of the general public and has no idea of what movie goers actually go to the movies for....to be entertained. Glad I own this film! This is one that did not do well at the box office but will be one that many will enjoy for years in the comfort of their own home.",4
  legendary plot with a killer soundtrack and stellar sets. characters exude emotion,4
  Awesome. Charlie was worth the wait . bought it as soon as the DVD come out,5
  A fresh take on a beloved story. I am looking forward to the sequels!,5
"  Not sure it even deserves two stars. Some of the camera shots are just terrible, along with the story, music, and everything else. Just isn't a good movie at all.",2
"  This was an excellent, fast paced film with plenty of credible action and great acting woven into a magical and atmospheric story of good versus evil",5
"  The worst film I've seen in a long time. A great mythical story with lots of potential to be a classic film turned into a gangster London style film with silly accent, names and poor acting.",0
  I loved this movie. The mixture of 3 stories in one was unique but Charlie needs to work on not sounding the same in every movie though. Great action flick!!,4
  Fair movie at best. Unworthy of a rewatch,2
  I had heard plenty of reviews saying the timeline was tough to follow and that the movie was bad. I had low expectations. The timeline thing...that's what Ritchie does so I wasn't worried about that. I will say this movie was just ok. Not sure I'll watch it again. The action was fine. The acting was ok. The plot was an interesting take.,2
  Very entertaining film. No idea why the reviews for it form the citics are so low.,4
"  I came in to this with rather low expectations and was blown away by what a fun movie this was; it felt like a bank-job movie met the Arthurian legend. The plot was (and quite fairly) predictable, but a very fun ride!",4
"  His name may be Guy, but he was the wrong guy to take on such a dull project with all show and no substance. It?s like getting to see, smell, touch and hear a mouthwatering medieval burger and not being able to eat any. You?re left angry and a bit confused as to why you?ve wasted this time.",2
"  Unintelligible, and not because of the accents. So this is a new take on the origins story of King Arthur (Charlie Hunnam). He's got to struggle to make it, but if he's determined enough... hell if I know. I can't even begin to tell you what this is about, as it is next to impossible to follow. You think this would be an easy movie to make, as this is a story that has been told before. Well, if you feel this way, you should prepare to be surprised. I sincerely encourage anybody out there to school me on what this movie is really about, because I kept losing track of what was happening any given scene as I was watching it, which is almost an accomplishment of sorts. Now this is from director Guy Ritchie, who carries a bit of a reputation. Don't get me wrong, I love Snatch, probably more than most, but the longevity of his career hasn't been the longest lasting. When it is him doing his very personal and unique thing with the script, I actually kind of like this, but it is few and far between, and even then, I had to completely ignore the fact that it is wildly incompatible with a King Arthur movie. The thing that is craziest here to me is that they wanted to Avengers this, establishing an Athurian cinematic universe (their words, not mine) that would span over half a dozen films. Choosing to both fly before they crawl and count their chickens before they hatch, this was an ill-conceived notion, and one that will clearly not be executed due to the box office failure of this. It would be different if this movie was just okay, but this is messy, and in a very unsavory and unappealing way. It reached the point where I simply looked away so I could take down a note like I do, and when I looked back up, I truly had no idea what was going on. This isn't me exaggerating, either; I was utterly lost trying to follow this. There is an abundance of flashbacks that don't make sense amongst oversized CGI elephants, which is not a sentence that I ever anticipated writing. I was baffled at every story turn, and please believe me when I say that I did make an effort with this. Hunnam is just doing a Jason Statham impression, and with Guy Ritchie behind the camera, you can't say that it is unexpected. There was nobody asking for this, and if you are lucky enough to have not seen King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, you should keep it that way.",1
"  Quite entertaining and vastly underrated by the useless so-called critics, as usual. It's fighting and magic in a medieval setting, better than quite a few we've had of late. Don't expect the usual run of the mill arthurian legends and you should have a decent time.",4
  At least the last quarter was good leaving me hopeful that the sequel is better if there is one.,2
  What an absolute load of rubbish looks amazing but it's almost and watchable I don't wanna waste too much more of my time on it except to give potential viewers a brief warning that this film is not engaging and the performances from the actors are an inspiring. On paper this should be good but in reality it is not,0
  Saw it on a recent flight. Trash. Just utter trash.,0
"  Great watch, massively underrated. critics are wrapped up in it being to far from the original story. The new one is far more interesting in my opinion. There are some amazing fight scenes and anybody who liked any of the previous Guy Richie movies will love this one.",4
  Being poorly scripted and lacking star power are contributing factors to this cinematic failure.,1
"  The critical reviews were so wrong, this movie was just plain fantastic. Knights Tale, LOTR, and the RDJ Sherlock Holmes movies rolled into one, it was fast-paced, action-packed, witty, and had the high-brow drama befitting the legend of King Arthur. 10/10 would see again, and definitely recommend.",5
"  Great cgi, sound, and the acting was worthwhile, too",4
"  Can't read critics anymore, out of touch with the people the viewers and reality, fantastic film hope there is a sequel",5
"  I thought it was fantastic. Yes the story is warped when compared to the original, however, lets be honest, do we really want to see the same story again? IMO this is a great spin off, of the epic with the great addition of the directors flair. 10/10 absolutely loved it.",5
"  Do you know what? This film isn't actually as terrible as the trailers would have you believe. Is it as cheesy as the trailers made out? Most definitely, but the film contains a rather unique value of entertainment within... cheesy entertainment nonetheless.Geezer-wannabe Guy Ritchie has become a film icon through his previous London crime capers such as 'Lock, Stock', 'Snatch' and 'RocknRolla' and has equally had a fair punt at more period pieces like 'Sherlock Holmes', however departing from the 1800's, he's taken a further step back in time to explore the Arthurian legends in 'King Arthur: Legend of the Sword'.Just last week I slated another fantasy film, Disney's recent mess of a film, the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' sequel. Now, this film, which is admittedly just an over-the-top cheesefest, should have received similar acclaim from me, but you know what, it isn't going to. A ""geezerfied"" King Arthur tale is something rather unique and despite its cheesiness and immaturity, it does provide some quality entertainment and likable characters. All I can add to this is, don't take the film seriously, it's a fantasy adventure with a Guy Ritchie Cockney twist, and of course a cameo from David Beckham... yeah.Ritchie employs his usual adrenaline-provoking cinematography, the score is equally as intense, with Celtic sounds added as a bonus, the acting (cameos aside) is far from subpar and the locations utilised from across the UK are absolutely stunning (particularly those from Snowdonia and the Highlands). Take the fantasy genre, blend in a completely contemporary stance, remove the glitz and glam of Hollywood and instead insert a gritty aesthetic, a few Cockney lads and fast-paced editing, and to top it off chuck Guy Ritchie in the directors chair, and that's what you've got...",0
"  Review:Although this movie looked pretty, and the CGI was used to it's full capacity, I still was left feeling a bit empty when the film finished. There wasn't much depth to the characters, except for King Arthur (Charlie Hunnam), who took ages to except the power of the sword, Excalibur but the rest of the characters gave there life for King, who didn't take his role seriously until the near end. I also think that Jude Law (Vortigern) was a bad choice as the villain, and Eric Bana (Uther) was taken out way to early. Anyway, the movie is about a king, Uther, who is loved by is Kingdom but is killed by his brother, Vortigern, so he can gain power and all of its riches. Whilst killing his brother, Arthur, Uther's young son, escapes in a boat but he witnesses the murder of his father, which sticks with him for the rest of his life. Arthur is then brought up in a brothel, were he saves his money and gains respect, as an adult, from his fellow villagers but Vortigern is having problems as the king, because he is feared more than loved by the kingdom. He then hears of a sword which is stuck in a rock, which can only be taken out by the King's son, so he sends men out to search for the Uther's son, to crush the myth that he is a true King. Now with Arthur captured, Vortigern attempts to kill Arthur in front of the whole village but he is saved by disciples, who believe that he can save the world from the evil Vortigern. With the magical sword in his power, Arthur and his disciples decide to take down Vortigern but he also has magical powers, after making a deal with the devil. Its truly an ""over the top"" storyline, full of magic, action and mythical characters but it takes too long to get going, and you don't get to see the power of the sword until the very end. Like every Guy Ritchie movie, we get the slow motion action scenes and banter between the characters but it wasn't enough to save this mediocre movie, which cost a hell of a lot of money to make. The wit throughout the film, didn't touch the clever writing in Lock Stock or Snatch, and the huge snake scene, along with the weird looking sea monster which was controlling Vortigern, looked completely ridiculous. Anyway, I wasn't a big fan of this movie and it seems like Guy Ritchie has lost his touch with his last few films but it's good to see him have a go at projects that are out of his comfort zone. Average!Round-Up:Guy Ritchie, 49, first hit the scene in 1998 with Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Swept Away, Revolver, Rocknrolla, 2 Sherlock Holmes movies and the Man from U.N.C.L.E., which have all made him a big player in Hollywood today. He's due to release a live action version of Aladdin starring Will Smith and Naomi Scott in 2019, and he has another Sherlock Holmes movie in the pipeline, so although this movie lost a lot of money at the box office, he's not holding back from the big budget projects. Charlie Hunnam, 37, first came to the big screen in Cold Mountain, which also starred Jude Law, and then he went on to star in Green Street, The Ledge, Deadfall, Pacific Rim, Crimson Peak and the Lost City of Z. Personally, I don't think he was the perfect choice for this movie, mainly because he didn't seem to blend in with the other characters but thats just me. Anyway, this movie is certainly large in scale but it just didn't work for me.Budget: $175millionWorldwide Gross: $149million (Flop!)I recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/dramas, starring Charlie Hunnam, Astrid Berges-Frisby, Jude Law, Djimon Hounsou, Eric Bana, Aidan Gillen, Freddie Fox and David Beckham. 5/10",2
"  Amongst so many negative reviews from critics, if you like Guy Ritchie films, you'll more than likely enjoy this classic tale with a twist of ""modern flash as the critics say. It is undoubtedly Guy Ritchie, and if you enjoy his other films than you'll know exactly what to expect. I DID go in with a lower expectation because of reviews. So maybe that made me enjoy it more than what most have said. Although, if you want to see the pre-King Arthur era with modern technology making it even bigger, do it and enjoy an action flick.",5
  Perfect amalgamation of what every film experience oughta strive to be! Loved it!,4
  1.5 out of 10:Good performances and cinematography can?t save this wannabe of Lord of the Rings and it also sacrifices the story of King Arthur in order to make it look like some modern day action film.,1
  I apologize I could only stand watching this movie for around 30 minutes. It was typical Guy Ritchie whose films I can't really stand.,0
  Absolutely fantastic movie. The actors picked for their rolls were on point. Great movie!,4
  Everytime I listen to the critics I miss out on a good movie or I'm left bitterly disappointed as they hype up a turd. See this movie and judge it yourself. I personally thought it was fantastic. To tell a story that everyone has heard a thousand times but have it feel like the first time is a great accomplishment. And Jude Law gives an epic performance.,5
"  This is an incredibly good movie. Jude Law is astonishing as the villain, even though I've seen him play the psychopath before. There are iconic scenes in this movie, scenes that will be remembered for ages, and any critic who failed to realize that needs to do us all a favor and find a new career. The tale is enthralling from beginning to end. I was enchanted. You will be too.",5
  Please don't show that flashback again.,1
  Awesome action story with fantastic music. Loved it!,5
"  O irmão do Rei Arthur mata ele e sua esposa, sendo que seu primogenito foge e vive em um bordel, alguns anos depois volta, pega sua espada e mata todo mundo... bons efeitos especiais e mas o filme é cansativo as vezes....",4
"  Stupid movie, but it did have some potential. Plot was ridiculous, unbelievable, and all over the place.",2
  Guy Richie maser. Som et lok'motiv. Hele tia!,2
"  This was a great movie that no one will ever see. Its a shame since it was so good. Great story, great cast, and hope there is a sequel",4
"  Weird, rushed and has a personality disorder",1
"  Fun movie and fast. other than that it's nothing.,",1
"  Great fun, fast paced and witty. Brilliant take on the legend.",4
"  Not completely unenjoyable, but also not nearly as fun as, say, Ritchie's Sherlock movies.",2
"  Please rotten tomatoes .. pull your head from you butt. This was totaly awesome .. and that soundtrack! I keep listening that again and again in my job and you know what? It is really good it has layers, greate piece of art. Some shit couldnt outlast hundreds of plays and be even better after. BTW: the movie works, not as legend about Aarthur, but as totally unique fantasy .. it has guts to be different. BTW FU for this score. These critics here so dumb :(",5
"  It may not be accurate to the mythos or the next Lord of the Rings, but it's entertaining as hell with gorgeous cinematography, fantastic action sequences, great performances from Charlie Hunnam and Jude Law, and a world that oozes with magical potential. Too bad we'll never see a sequel.",5
  better than I thought it would be,4
"  Just really quite dreadful rubbish, with a huge budget, and zero talent from the two stars. Don?t pay a cent to see this catastrophic effort at film making.",1
  Fun and enjoyable movie. Worth a watch and I bet you'll be surprised how much you liked it by the time it ends.,5
  Excellent fight scenes.,4
  I enjoyed the new take on the movie,5
  Real bad. Arthur's a pimp.,2
  King Arthur: Legend of the Sword overuses style heavy action sequences which takes out the classic feel to the legend of King Arthur while the plot builds up too much for the audience to keep engaged.,1
  One of the worst movies I've ever watched. The acting was terrible and the story was completely pointless. I would rather experiment with how hard a fully grown male gorilla could clamp my balls than rewatch this utter disaster of a movie.,0
  A steaming pile of movie garbage. I want those 2+ hrs. of my life back.,0
  Most amazing movie I have seen in awhile love it love it can't wait for the next chapter,5
  best move iv seen in at least the last 5 years,5
"  Ohhh God... this was so bad. The overrated director did it again. What could have been a very good Arthurian story is filled with bad dialogue, uninteresting characters (I think the worst is Arthur himself), plot with lots of holes, bland. Nice CGI btw.... in the first 10mns... then soporific at is best.",2
"  Rock N Rolla meets Lord of the Rings, what's not to like?",4
  The subjects have spoken and the nobility doesn't like it.,4
"  I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!! If you know the legends of Camelot or you don't you should watch this movie prepared to enjoy a good story with Kings, Magic, heroes, villains, epic sword fights, even some cheeky humor. What you should not expect is to find a noble pagentry of folk lore. This is a great story of good triumphing over evil. Not sentimental but the the type of story that will take you for a great ride. Have only one expectation; to be entertained. Watching this movie was like 'seeing' the story any warrior could have told over a camp's fire. Just enjoy it, just go with it......Keep in mind that the legends of King Arthur are just that; legends. Every story teller through out time has retold legends in their own way. Guy Ritchie is a story teller and damn good at crafting his stories into visual form. Put away your memories of the story tellers that came before and let this one tell you his version. It's fun!",5
  I AM FAN OF GUY RITCHIE AND THIS FILE WAS GOOD. I HOPE TO SEE A BETTER SEQUEL,4
  An enjoyable movie!I wasn't expecting much but I do enjoy Guy Ritchie's characters recapping events. They are always entertaining.,4
"  Fantastic take on the Authurian legend. Yes, it is extremely far from the mythology but that is what makes this movie great. A fresh take on a fantastic figure in history is not a bad thing when that figure, already a bad ass as is, is made even more bad ass in a modern telling like this. The soundtrack was a perfect tie in to the action and the actors, ALL OF THEM, had the right amount of chemistry to make the movie work. Just a fantastic adrenaline rush to entertain those who appreciate a movie for what it is- an action packed, shoot em up, down and dirty bit of fun.A reviewer made an excellent point that many movie critics miss the mark on what makes a movie great. I want to be entertained when I see a movie such as this. The vast difference in the Tomato score versus the audience score is a testament that the critics aren't always the ""go to"" for info on what the masses may or may not enjoy.Look, I know that this movie isn't an authentic retelling - so what!?!? If I want see a bit of cinematic authenticity I will break out my old John Boorman rendition of the Authurian legend Excalibur as a reminder.",5
"  Loved this movie!! All political correctness aside, this tribute to the legend of King Arthur is exciting and sassy! I wish I had seen it in theaters ??Really cool movie, cool soundtrack??",5
  A very well written script along with great acting. One of the few movies that made you fall in love with the hero without doing too much but doing just enough. Great great great!,5
"  Love the story, plot, cast. Amazing movie all around. Special effects were great also",5
"  Love Guy Ritchie movies, and glad to see it kept with this usual story telling style, and the special effects were good, but that's where the GOOD ends. Horrible casting. The Mage looked as if she were constipated the entire time and trying to remember her lines (the kid Blue acted better than she did), and Arthur was just a horribly bad choice in leads. Even the action fell flat when the main character was involved. They relied on CGI in order to make him fit into the role they cast him in.Very disappointing. Story was a bit jumbled and really didn't make the view give a shit about any of the characters or the flight of the english. The secondary characters were the best part of the movie, but there was only so much they could do.",2
"  I'm helplessly ignorant about the tale of King Arthur, so I had no loyalty to the story to disappoint. I loved the modern style of this medieval movie. Great cinematography and characters were easy to love. My favorite movie since Mad Max Fury Road.",5
"  Weird. Start to finish, weird. Take everything you know about King Arther...and forget it. Even then, you will not enjoy this.",1
"  I thought this film was poorly done. I like the idea of filming a modern/grittier tale of a classic... but what was this trash? The characters sucked, casting sucked, (Thx progressive SJW crap) the verbiage was crap, the blend of what seems to be a Lord of the Rings-knock off-anime depiction story to add fantasy CGI effects rather than a substantive thrilling adventure tale.",2
  Lengedary Story told bya modern story teller mixed with CGI from LOTR and 300.ð???,2
"  Such a shame the ""professional"" reviewers panned this movie and killed the sequels.",5
"  So i know what you're probably thinking... ""here we go again with yet another rendition of the King Arthur story"". And i get it, it's exactly what I thought when I wasn't impressed too much by the trailers and when the poor reviews came out. But what director Guy Ritchie does here by bringing his style of filmmaking and a 21st century feel to this familiar story makes for a very engaging, fun, and enjoyable ride that I for one didn't expect. Charlie Hunnam plays Arthur and leads an impressive cast from Jude Law (Vortigern) to Djimon Hounsou (Sir Bedivere) who all put in strong performances in a film that takes itself seriously enough to where it can still have a great deal of fun within the fantasy world. The film follows Arthur who fights his way to prominence whilst dealing with acknowledging his legacy in order to face his uncle Vortigern who has since seized the crown that was once his fathers. Visually it is incredible, there is some light humour spread throughout, and there is just so much excitement to be had with this movie. I will begin with the star of the film who is without a doubt Guy Ritchie, his distinct style is very evident throughout all or most scenes and it is the reason you are able to separate this film from the other Arthurian legends. He utilises a style that brings a modern atmosphere to a classic tale and time period making it a very fun time but still retaining the core components of the legend. A few times during the film he utilises a fast paced montages extremely effectively and for a number of reasons. One being to obviously skip ahead a large amount of time whilst still understanding the important events that occurred, and another reason was to make potentially boring sequences fast paced interesting. Rather than telling some events in a strictly linear format he very successfully represents the pre-planning stage, planning stage, and execution stage of an action sequence all within the same montage of scenes in a very upbeat way. Without Guy Ritchie's involvement this probably would have been as dull and bland as it appeared to be from the outset. The cast here involves some big names, all of whom deliver with their characters whether that be in a main or more supporting role. Some of the very well executed supporting performances include those by Djimon Hounsou (Sir Bedivere), Aidan Gillen (Goosefat Bill), and Astrid Berges-Frisbey (The Mage) who were all very fun to watch and I was able to get behind their likeable characters. Aidan Gillen I wasn't sure was cast accurately when the film began but as time went on I warmed up to his character more and more. Jude Law plays the big villain and he proves again can successfully play a very good villain as he brings a sense of personality to a character who could have been just super serious evil guy #31. Charlie Hunnam who plays the lead is by far the highlight and plays a very likeable lead to where you are rooting for this guy the entire time, and not just because he is Arthur. He deals with a very fun and charismatic personality and can still deliver on the more serious personal choices his character faces. One thing I also want to note is that this movie is visually phenomenal. Everything in this world looked so damn real it was hard to admit at some points that certain elements were CGI. From the landscapes to the large castles to large creatures everything looked spot on. Now I know where the majority of the monstrous $175M budget was spent. One role I want to bring up is Annabelle Wallis' role in the film, I was pleasantly surprised to see that she was in the movie and then to see that she has only a handful of short scenes and doesn't really do much was a little disappointing I must admit. I for one wouldn't mind seeing a sequel set in the world or even a prequel set during the opening scene with Eric Bana and Jude Law's characters. But considering the film bombed and failed to make back its budget at the box office there is next to no way that is going to happen. So in the end I think it's safe to say i was incredibly surprised by how much I enjoyed this damn movie. I thought it would be dull, slow, and just a very bland King Arthur story but it's the complete opposite of that. It was fast paced, engaging, fun, and the implementation of Ritchie's light humour made the whole thing very upbeat. I was waiting for a drop in quality somewhere, not because I wanted it rather because I didn't think it could keep up the act for two whole hours. But it does and i have to say, disregard the reviews and if you are a fan of these types of films especially the King Arthur story check this out because it is considerably better than it is made out to be. 7.7/10",4
  This movie was actually one of the funniest takes on this story. It's actually sad and odd it didn't do well in theaters. But I did enjoy it quite a lot. Only reason I can see as to why it didn't do well was because it went up against heavy hitters like Logan at the time.,5
"  Rotten tomatoes is a lousy reviewer. They give all good movies bad rating but will give a 90 percent to a shite drama that was over hyped and then got horrible reviews from the people but since it has an important lesson or women activists actors or an actor that is in the spotlight or other critics that follow the same guidelines like it, it will get a good rating. I have watched this movie and it was really good and has a lorlt of potential with sequels. In box office it did have tough competition and it times medieval movies don't get a lot of attention anymore which is quite a same. It also didn't get as much attention in its pre release stage and a lot of negative attention before it made it to theatre. The acting was good. The CGI was exceptional. The action kept your attention. It had very thought out comic relief. It had a dark passion/drama to it. The interpretation of the King Arthur story was a nice twist from others. It had good actors. The back story leading all the way up to the last moment of the movie was suspenseful. The story was excellent at it would be a shame if they didn't make a sequel. I like all movies and I dislike a lot as well but this one reminded me of when movies were actually a long though out process and not just a thrown idea and a bunch of action and comedy or horror or drama. Good talk.",5
  I watched this out of desperation. Love historical based or historical fiction films but whenever King Arthur is tackled it seems to fall short. This one was great. Not the best thing I've ever seen but definitely worth watching. Solid film.,5
"  Wish I saw King Arthur on the big screen. As for the critics, they don't know what entertains them anymore. For me though, this movie had it all. The cast was killer. Loved Charlie Hunham, Eric Bana, Jude Law, and David Beckham's short bit. The costumes were cool. The sets and effects I found impressive. The film's pace and cockney dialog was classic Ritchie. The story was also pretty epic. A must buy/add to my collection!",4
  Fantastic movie! Great cinematics. I am hoping am looking very forward to more chapters.,5
"  We found this movie very entertaining. Yes, the storyline was a little lacking and left us wanting a more in some areas, but overall, this was a good movie. We have watched it a couple times now, and enjoy it still. Charlie Hunnam is awesome in this movie.",4
  Great movie really enjoyed it.,5
"  What ? Whatwhatwhatwhat ? I think this is the worst movie i've seen this year.Everything looks cheap. Everything looks fake. It sounds, and looks like a joke to the face of King Arthur's fan.The screening is bad, the colors are bad, the scenario is out of hell, the costumes *oh damn they're bad*...And why the heck Arthur looks like a viking mixed with an hipster ?!And why the heck elephant from LOTR are here ?!",0
"  Loved this movie. Not sure why the critics cannot enjoy a well acted, fun to watch movie. Look forward to seeing it again when its streaming.",5
"  fantastic, lost a star cuz some of the scenes seem choppy for no real reason.",4
"  Lots of awesome and big action sequences. Although much of it was confusing and fast paced, I felt it had a decent storyline. I just wish they would have made it longer so they could explain things better.",4
"  Needless, uneventful, and low stakes make for a movie that wants to be everything at once but can't even focus its camera on one shot for more than two seconds.",2
"  This is my first review EVER! The Critics? Well, their doing their job, but they should have more heart, instead of looking for all the negativity in things. The Movie? I've seen so many movies! And once in awhile you get these, 300, 300 Rise of an empire, 13 Hours, just to name a few, and now King Arthur! Charlie Hunnan? My man was badass in this! Jude Law? Great job! The music? Prefectly badass for this movie! All the actors were, no matter how small a part were fantastic! The twist? Guy Ritchie kicked ass! The only thing they could have tweaked was the giant snake at the end, a lil too computerized graphics, and they should have had Charlie fight more using his hands before crushing them with the sword, but I definitely hope there's a sequel, because this movie may not be a critics dream, but the more you watch it, the more you'll love it! I I've seen it 6 times already, lol.",5
"  Cool twist on the story, well directed and not cheesy. Great for fans of the fantasy genre. I was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed it. I hope there is a sequel.",5
  I didnt mind this amongst the shit of cgi thrown in but it had characters that were alright and it was better then that fucking piece of shit alien convenant film which isnt saying much as my shit tells a better story then that film,2
"  This movie was perfectly coherent and successful on its own terms. It was a gangsta/Robin Hood portrayal of the Arthur legend, but I have to say it was a rollicking ride, engaging, and powerful. It clearly borrowed from Jackson's Lord of the Rings, but then its art director also borrowed from Paul Delaroche, Lawrence Alma-Tadema, and Arnold Bocklin. A ripping yarn!",5
  I'm a fan of Guy's directing ... music and action sequences reminiscent of Sherlock Holmes ... wish he'd design a virtual reality video game.,4
"  Underwhelming, the performances are not so good, the way the story is told its inconsistent and anticlimactic.The characters are not interesting, and I was unable to feel empathy for any of them.The only good thing are the action pieces, the cgi and music.",2
"  Guy Ritchie brigs his signature style to the Arthurian legend, with a fast pace, snappy dialogue and dazzling action scenes. This is not your typical King Arthur movie. If you're after grand story telling, deep character moments and interesting additions to the King Arthur legend, find it else where.",4
"  This movie received a 27% (for whatever reason), but has been one of the better movies I have seen this year. Guy Richie did a great job directing, as well as the actors did in their roles. If you want to see a great movie, and can dismiss the idiocy of the ""Tomatometer"" you will enjoy a great flick.",4
"  I... don't get the critics. This movie wasn't brilliant. But it was good. It was enjoyable. It had humor, some good acting, a straightforward, but understandable plot, and LOTS of nice style and action. It's a good action-fantasy romp, far better than something like Gods of Egypt (which come on wasn't even that bad). People don't really give a crap about the classics unless there's style... and there was some nice style and polish on this story. Put it shortly, Arthur gave me what I wanted and a bit of what I didn't expect. Great style, a complicated but compelling performance of Arthur and good action. I loved the soundtrack. I even thought the Villain was alright. The only thing I would like is a bit of a better characterised, but smaller supporting cast, but that was my only qualm.",4
  The story and camera angles were all over the place. The soundtrack was too often discordant with the scene. The final fight was awesome however.,2
"  shocked how much i disliked this movie is. separately I'm a big fan of both King Arthur and Guy Richie, but apparently the mixture does not agree with my taste. I honestly tried to watch it twice, but couldn't make it all the way to the end.",0
"  Popcorn action candy - nothing more, nothing less.",2
  fuck u critics masterpis,5
"  Wickedly fun. I liked it. Not flawless, but totally cool.",4
  A fresh take on an old story. Not the Arthur story we know to the tee but a nice perspective.,5
"  Even the incredible Jude Law didn't help make this version of the classic Arthurian Legend quite so enjoyable-sometimes hard to follow, odd placement of humor and direction with the movie. Entertaining still, but nothing too dazzling",2
"  2.5/5 starsA chaotic take on King Arthur that reminded me at times of Mad Max: Fury Road or 300 with its hard charging action and frenetic nature. Overall it wound up being OK, but just never really pulled it all together",2
"  In a time period when people are in the favor of nostalgia more than creatives just for the story change, better resolution and character development in modern remakes and reboots. In the last 5-10 years, audiences are still riding on the bandwagon of nostalgia and won't stop begging for remake/reboot and another and another. What's the point with having more & more remakes and reboots today? Money? The answer is no. Hollywood nowadays only remake/reboot classic films and movie franchises for young people (from age of 5 to 29 years old) who have never heard of or watched the original properties and for nostalgic people who wants to watch for a different story with better technology. Who the hell cares about the modern technology like graphic, resolution and such? Do you think a remake with 720p/1080p graphic would approve something from the old movie? Today's technology don't mean anything and it does not make movie remakes/reboots any better. Again, what's the point? Do you have problem watching a 1981 film, ""Excalibur"", that's running at 144p/240p on VHS or 360p/480p on DVD? Does the late 70's and early 80's resolution give you a headache? I tell ask you again: What's the point? Alright, let's talk about the story change. I wouldn't want to watch this remake/reboot because I have seen Disney's Sword in the Stone, a 1981 film and, of course, a 2004 reimagine movie. I recall this movie is about Arthur discovers the sword called Excalibur and then something possessing him. When Arthur mind was controlled by a demon, he becomes possessed and walk towards the sword and take it out of the stone. After the moment possessed Arthur took the sword, he murder almost all innocent people at night and will continue to kill for his mercy. He has turned to the dark side. Here, that's the proof why this was remade/rebooted. What's the point watching this remake/reboot/reimagine if you have seen some of the old King Arthur movies before? Are you suffering nostalgia for this remake/reboot? The problem that you have never seen the old properties is the reason why this remake/reboot was made for you? Are you homeless for not watching the old movies? Don't you have enough money to buy old movies on DVD or Blu-ray? What the hell is wrong with you?All in all, this isn't or wasn't a King Arthur movie you're looking for. If you want a movie with better storytelling, film-making and quality, I recommend you to watch a 1981 film, ""Excalibur"", whose movie that really holds up today. Very underrated movie. I would say just to skip the 2004 one and this remake/reboot. Have a good one!",0
"  Beginning was very good, some effects cool. Didn't like his character or the way of filming. Showed immediately present/future. Eric Bana was good",2
  Very good movie. I'm not sure what people were expecting from the trailers but I believe it delivered what it promised. It was a gritty down to earth spin on the story which turned out really enjoyable if you take it for what it is instead of trying to compare it to other versions.,5
  I don't know what the critics were thinking. Maybe they don't like the director or something. All they did was lose any credibility. This movie is a work of art. Every part of it was great.,5
"  It's a fun, good looking movie. Not your typical period movie. I love the clothes and the music. I don't understand why such a low tomatometer score",5
"  The movie is good. It is written well. It has a gritty, earthy tone which is one of the better things about the movie. The stylisation is good, the movie looks good. The mythological aspects of the movie look good and feel good. They are trippy, grand and appealing to the eye. The movie does have 1 or 2 pitfalls. There are some distinguishable guy ritchie traits in storytelling which seem a little out of place in this time period. They could have been pulled off better. The trope of Arthur not wanting to take his responsibilty is played for too long. In turn this gives the movie a pacing problem. Charlie Hunnam's acting at times was not up to standard. Apart from all that the movie is exciting and looks good and the storyline fits together well. A possible sequel is hinted at which also brings excitement.",4
"  Love this twist on the old story, really enjoyed it. Probably have to watch it a couple of times to catch it all, but I am looking forward to it...",5
  An attempt at an ultra cool hip telling of a classic story that just comes off as weird and disjointed.,2
"  my rating based on that it was enjoyable to go on the ride, great music, and clever. way too sci-fi for me but a very well made well, written movie worth watching, and funny too. this being said having no idea of the original story.",4
  this movie is so awesome I loved it I would recommend it to anyone,5
  Great movie filled with humor and action! Terrific story telling! There wasn't a single dull moment,4
  Not bad. Plenty of action. Fight scenes reminded me of 300,4
  Fun old school King Arthur movie. Not about lancelout and his knights,5
  The second worst retelling Of the Arthurian legends that I have seen. Kung-Fu theater meets The Little Princess...,1
  A really enjoyed it.... it was funny and badass!,0
"  Don't waste your time like I unfortunately did when I decided to watch this new gaggle of a film. Extremely boring and poorly written. Too much CGI to boot. Let's just say, I knew this was gonna be a terrible movie after the first 3 minutes of wasted electricity.",0
  Really liked this movie,4
"  Not sure what the critics are smoking - this movie was awesome - great story, great action, great cast, great movie!!",5
  This movie was good. Don't go in to watch this move thinking that they have reinvented the wheel. This movie is good if you don't look for some intellectual brain drain of a movie. Enjoy the action and explosions. If that isn't your thing...then this isn't the movie for you.,4
"  It was no Oscar winner but was entertaining, and that is what I look for.",4
  freaking cool! love it,5
  2 hours of my life wasted,0
  Fun movie that was released just a bit too early in the year,5
  I speak for the general public when I say that this movie is absolutely amazing. Guy Richie has outdone himself!,5
"  A very interesting style of direction, with the fast-forwarding cinematography. The costumes look pretty cool, and Jude Law does his part to be evil. The film doesn't aim to explain all the deep mythical history of the film. The final battle, while cool, was too cliche. Still a nice movie to watch for it's fantasy rendition of an old story.",4
"  Great sound and action, great actors, solid story, moves slowly but steadily to fulfill the Arthur tale... different from the old merlin and boy arthur, but a great film that I found moving and entertaining.",5
  pretty much as expected...watchable b movie,2
  I actually like the movie Just Enough changes to make it interesting.,4
"  Better than reviewed, but definitely not Ritchie's best work",4
  The critics are dead wrong about this flick. It was entertaining and was a fresh take on an old tale. It is not perfect by any means but it will appeal to those who enjoy highly stylized visual story telling.,4
  Glad to see a new twist on the old and tired story of King Arthur. Enjoyed a great amount,4
"  while the flashy direction and hunmans performance are entertaining, the movie is just all over the place and a mess",2
"  The medieval ages of mystics, and mages, and magic. Diving deep into the surreal and paranormal, which I usually despise in movies, is brought out to fight evil for once. Merlin and Arthur 2 of the most powerful men in English folklore history. Predictable, maybe, but when done with eloquence and colorful tapestry it is much more than tolerable.No spoilers here. Jude Law (king Vortigern) is always brilliant. Eric Bana (Uther) is a powerful albeit minor supporting actor. The CGI is used for amazing scenes that move the plot along with fervor. The tale is told with enough refreshing twists that make it unique, yet more believable and exciting than other remakes (anyone remember Robinhood king of theives?).Â I will never understand the Trolls who put the negative reviews on such masterpieces like this King Arthur movie. I am glad I read a lot of the great reviews by those who appreciated thus movie on Redbox than the ignoramuses who tried to skewer a well written and directed movie.When a movie transports your mind, heart, and soul to a time and you really feel like you are there then it has accomplished the directors every dream. I stopped watching Game if Thrones because they are more focused on nudity, violence, and profanity then the storytelling. How refreshing it is to have a meaningful dialogue and still embrace the beauty of goodwilled ladies and children. The might and Chivalry that comes to mind whoever I think of Camelot.Â Sean Connery has to be impressed. Errol Flynn would have been impressed with the accomplishments that reminisce those of Robin Hood and his merry men and Sherwood Forest. One of my favorite movies of all time. The comparison itself places this on an equal plane. I would go as far as putting it with Lord of The Rings (blasphemous?)Â Major props to the lead actor Charlie Humnam who plays Arthur, Djimon Hounsou (Bedivere), and Aiden Gillen (Bill). Special shout out to Neil Baskel (Back Lack) who I love in in PBS show humans, Astrid BergÃ¨s-Frisbey (mage). Perfect casting by Reg Poerscout-Edgerton (Guardians of the Galaxy, Dr Strange to name a couple others). Even David Beckham (yes the soccer player) was cast well.Finally I am newest Guy Ritchey fan. The choreography of all scenes was infinitesimal. He wrote and Directed ""Legend if the Sword."" The musical score (too many to mention) is to enhance a movie not dominate it (see Dunkirk). The Set directing, Costume design, sound editing, movie editor...all superb.The so-called critics really missed the mark on this one!!! I guess the 146.2 million USD box office tells the true story.Disclaimer...King Arthur and Excaliber have always been a secret fantasy of mine. Hopefully Guenevere will be in part II.",4
  Love this telling of the story!,4
  I really enjoyed it :) Im a fan of King Arthur's movies since my childhood..and this one was really fun. Just lacked more fights using the sword in my opinion but maybe they didn't want to make the movie seem more science fiction :),4
  Moments of greatness overshadowed by huge confusing gaps in the story and ridiculously out of place sequences,2
  Awesome action and loved the humor!,5
"  muy entretenida la historia, y con efectos geniales :D",5
"  Seriously one of the absolute best movies I've seen in a VERY long time! Well written, well casted, well directed - all around phenomenal movie. Do yourself a favor and don't pay attention to the crappy reviews the critics gave - watch this movie and thank me (in your head) later! Lol",5
  This movie was freaking awesome! I loved it beginning to end. The world building and exposition is incredible in this film. I LOVED the way the flash backs in the beginning filled in WHO King Arthur really was :) the magic was epic and mysterious; the story itself was compelling to me because it had great characters and chemistry on set. It felt very Oceans Eleven meets LOTR... meets MISTBORN. Loved it CANT WAIT FOR KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE. ??????,5
"  This movie was freaking great. It had the cleverness of Ocean's Eleven, with the poetic epicness of Hamlet. It was just awesome.",5
  awesome moving really enjoyed it the whole family,5
  I was very happy to see a Guy Ritchie movie again. His direction is always very original and refreshingly different than everything else out there.,4
"  There were moments of shades of a great movie, and the rest appeared to be a precursor for a video game.",2
  Don't understand users and critics hate? I waited a while to rent as a result! Sorry now that I didn't see it at the theater. I guess critics and some people just don't get Guy Ritchie! Acquired taste I guess. But I've liked all his movies. It was so much fun with good acting and CGI! Watch it!,4
"  I was really surprised to see this got 28%. I thought the movie was kind of innovative in that the comedy actually worked in this action movie. I liked the part where you saw the actors as if the camera was attached to the bodies. I really liked this movie, I thought it was pretty good!",5
  the story is rushed and all over the place. good graphics though.,2
"  The director said he was a fan of John Boorman's Excalibur... well, Boorman's Excalibur was 100% better than this piece of @#%!. Uninteresting characters... buffoons instead of knights... what a DISASTER of a movie...",1
  Very thrilling and action packed,4
  LOVE THIS MOVIE! how did it get rated so low?!,5
  great movie. loved the little comedy it had in it. I hoped he would have some romance with the girl but still good.,4
  Unexpected good time.,4
  Don't really care about critics rating as they always are wrong or atleast most of the times. Move was very good 10/10.,5
  1st part had everything going for it.Fell down terribly in its second half.,2
"  It had/has potential, but neither Ritchie or Hunnam ends up making much of it.",2
  Solid fun with unique modern pace. Enjoyed every minute. Critics really got this one wrong!,5
"  It's Guy Ritchie's version of the King Arthur tale so instead of the characters being named Sir Galahad, Sir Lancelot, and Lady Guinevere, they have names like Goosefat Bill, Kung-fu George, and Wet Stick.",2
  I have no idea why the critics were not kind to this film. A brilliant film in just about every category. Just hoping they make more...,5
"  Truly rotten. Hunnam, a good actor, is wasted in this. In this film Guy Ritchie, the director, has created a very derivative charmless mess that utterly fails to understand and indeed destroys the appeal of Arthurian myth. This movie even imports Nazi imagery to define The Evil King (played cheesily by Jude Law) as Evil. Revolting garbage.",1
"  8/10 different, strange",4
  Couldn't even finish watching this movie.,2
  I Like Charlie Hunnam acting in this movie.,5
"  Brilliant movie. A few fight scenes were a little too CG, and the chemistry between Arthur and the Mage was a little forced, but overall a solid movie.",4
  The Matrix and Lord Of The Rings mashed with a dash of Arthurian legend! Great actors! But seriously? The GoPro shots? Big ass Elephants and the basilisk from Harry Potter? We watched it over as a comedy and it was much better!,1
"  Ay man when that nigga sliced that demon dude, that was like some king arthur shit you hear about in the legends that you hear about from like your grandpa or somethin.",5
  Fantastic! Loved it.,5
  Loved this movie! Guy Richie brought an old tired story into the 21st century. Fun to watch from start to finish.,5
"  While this may not be a ""traditional"" King Author story, it is a good tale. Different in its presentation but just enough to help you get to the meat of the story. The thing about King Author as ahold it lends itself to be told in different ways and since it not meant to be a historical representative if facts the basic theme comes out. Which is doing what is right will prevail against evil.",4
"  Everything i could want in a movie. Giant elephants, cool magic, sword fights... Yet somehow despite that, this movie is dull as rocks and an ordeal to get through.",1
"  Half an hour in and we had to turn of off because it was so bad. The constant cutting and chopping of scene, it was like Lock stock and smoking barrels/ Gilmore girls, with narrative flashbacks that was too hard to follow witj the eye. Such a disappointment.",0
  Rey Arturo. La leyenda de Excalibur [2017],4
  Worst directing ever. Bought it On Demand for $7 and had to stop it after 5 minutes. Great scenery wasted on rapidly moving pace with no explanation or character development,0
  Great cast and special effects!! The movie was all over the place n hard to understand what was going on. Definitely not what I thought it'd be like. I don't recommend it unless u juz watch it for the special effects n cast.,2
"  I usually don't pay attention to the critics reviews, but in this case I should have. I didn't even make it halfway through this 3rd rate rendition before turning it off. At least only $2 wasted at Redbox.",1
"  Fantastic Guy Richie style take on King Arthur ,love it recommend to watch , I will add it to my collection of motion pics such as Excaliber, Clive Owens King Arthur , Sean Connery King Arthur , and Now Guy Richie's all good and different takes on story.",5
  Great movie! Great soundtrack. I definitely would've seen this at the movies if I would've known it was there and if it would've been there for more than a week. I don't think it did well at the box office because they didn't do a good job promoting the movie. One of the best movies I've seen recently. Hopefully they'll still continue with the franchise.,5
"  I loved this movie. Absolutely loved it! Charlie was incredible, as well as the rest of the cast. Jude Law was intimidating and evil. I've seen all the King Arthur movies and didn't need to see more of the same. This was fresh and fast paced with a great comedic touch. The critical reviews seemed really harsh to me. A shame. Good news is, according to Variety, the movie took the top spot in DVD/Blu-ray sales charts for the week ending August 12th. I've enjoyed it several times to date!",5
  If you like Guy Ritchie movies you'll like this,4
"  awesome movie, lots of action and shows how different from other king Arthur movies. it's not like the same plot, no this one sure has a impact of thrills.",5
"  Fun, entertaining movie a wonderful refreshing twist on a fantasy classic. Check it out!",5
"  Classic Guy Ritchie film in a medieval setting, with a touch of extrordinary dark fantasy CG. A refreshing viewing experience!",5
"  Leave it to Guy Ritchie to take a legend and twist it into a overloaded concoction that tries to fuse films like ""Snatch"", ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Knights of the Round Table"". The result is an unwelcome bloody mess. I like Charlie Hunnam a lot. I just hope he gets a role that is worthy of him eventually.",2
  I enjoyed the movie. It doesn't necessarily follow the legend but the movie kept me entertained.,4
"  It's a shame, Charlie is one of my favorite actors, and all though his acting is great, this movie was terrible. I love these kind of movies but it did not have my attention, I also did not like all the narratives that happened with the action......disappoinment for sure.",0
"  Guy Ritchie's adaptation of the classic tale of King Arthur will definitely get some mixed opinions. It boosts CGI up the ass, but if you appeal more to big budget movies, then you're bound to enjoy it, and definitely the best thing about the film is Charlie Hunnam, he really was the best choice to play King Arthur. It is indeed over-stylized and the CGI does saturise the flick a little, almost to the point that it ain't even artistic anymore, but, like I said it's for those who love that kind of pic. And I found the movie enjoyable. Recommended !!",4
"  Critics got it wrong. It is a good and very entertaining movie. Maybe does not represent 100% the King Arthur legend, but it is a fresh view!",5
"  Some decent action sequences, but the film is overall very silly with a sluggish plot and an over-the-top performance by Jude Law.",2
  Could finish it. Just BAD.,1
"  Guy Ritchie's style oddly meshes with this effects heavy action adventure that entertains throughout. King Arthur isn't a gamechanger, but it does most of what it sets out to do well enough. The acting, visuals, and most of the action and setpieces are a joy to behold. Some better scripting and at times tighter tweaking of the pacing would've elevated the film.",4
  I signed up just to see if it was possible to rate a movie with just the barest tip of one star. Stuck with 1/2. This movie represents the upcoming death of Western Civilization. Thanks for this loser of a sign post Ritchie.,0
"  You can't replace dialogue, characters, and a plot with CGI editing-but I guess no one told Guy Ritchie that. This unapologetically mind-numbing film reeks with undeserved swagger, much like the frat bro who just bought a new pair of weed-patterned socks. A real guys-guys film for when you've blacked out drinking tequila.",0
"  Loved it, it was awesome, a lot of testosterone, if your into chick flicks, you probably won't like this movie lmfao, but yeah guy flick, killing beatingthe hell outta people and the story is awesome enjoy peeps",5
  It was ok. But a little off,2
  REALLY hope they make another one!!,5
"  not the same old disney classic, it's fresh and well filmed",5
  A relatively messy style of story telling but is good enough for a lazy afternoon with low expectations.,4
  Just saw it on DVD and it was a great movie. Soundtrack was excellent! Guy Ritchie and the cast were great. Ignore the critics on this one.,5
  A solid movie with awesome action scenes just uses a little to much slow-mo,4
  loved it and Charlie is so good in this roll,5
  Why is the rated bad this was a good movie.,5
"  Oh screw the critics on this one. I love this version of King Author. A Guy Richie twist on a old story that has been told over and over again and again with the same results. Being a Big fan of Guy Richie films I say again he knocks it right out of the park. Critics give it 150 Rotten Tomatoes and 58 Fresh. I say get your heads out your unimaginative ass and think outside the box.I'd been looking at this title for a while thinking haven't they made this movie more then enough times. How many more ways can they present it? I finally hit the play button and up pops Richies name. Immediately I knew I was in for a ride. Not at all disappointed.If you loved RocknRolla, Revolver, Sherlock Homes, Snatch or even Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, you will love this version of King Author.",5
  oh yeah i would love to see it,4
"  I love the legend of Arthur and I thought this was a fun retelling of the story. I know a lot of critics bashed it, but I was overly entertained during the whole film. It was definitely setting up the universe of King Arthur. I really wish they had made more money so they could've went with their plans on doing a trilogy. Three 2.5 hr movies would wrap the complete series nicely.",5
"  Great movie, like game of thrones but better cinematography",5
"  Oh, Guy Ritchie. What have you done to the wonderful story of King Arthur? The cast was solid and the story was interesting, but the ridiculous direction brought things way down.",2
  really enjoyed it...David Beckham made me chuckle,4
"  I simply don't get why the critics are so harsh on this movie. It's simply awesome. Great skills in story telling; great pace achieved through effective use of kinetic shots; surprisingly deep characters in a movie packed with so much action, you'd think there's hardly any room left for character development.All in all, an epic tale told with a modern gangster movie touch, resulting in a both refreshing and rewarding experience!",5
  I love the music and liked the movie.,5
"  Quite okay in fact. Not perfect, but Guy Richie managed to pull something off quite well. Much like his Rock N'Roll version of Sherlock Holmes, this interpretation uses the same type of formula. The fight scenes are elegant and the style of the movie is appreciable. The pacing seemed rushed a bit on the first half of the movie, but the use of magic and lore do it for me. Just please.. to all movie directors... Stop it with the shaky cam !",2
  This movie was not what I expected. Found it to be boring and the story was not very good. I will skip this movie unless you really liked the preview.,1
"  Great movie, would of done much better if it had come out on a different weekend.",4
"  The abysmal reviews of this movie really weren't fair to it. The biggest flaw this movie has is that it uses the King Arthur name to throw together a bunch of unrelated people and events that have no accuracy to any of the literature or legends. If it were to just be marketed as a new fantasy without tying on to known characters and legends it would be more enjoyable and more followable. I really rather liked the fast helter-skelter pace, it just took a while to figure out what the hell was going on because there was no possible way, even if you make him a sorcerer, for Mordred to be old enough to kill Arthur's father, so it took me the entirety of the opening scene to figure out what the hell was going on just in time for it to not be going on anymore. The entire feeling of the plot felt much more Robin Hood than King Arthur. But the characters were likeable (at least the ones that were meant to be), the deaths that were supposed to hit hard landed, and Arthur was a hottie. I do think planning a 6 film franchise was wildly premature, but as a stand alone movie it was enjoyable. Once you get past that ""That isn't RIGHT"" thing happening in your brain about the legendary accuracy.I'm still confused about the... River hags? I don't know of them in Arthurian lore or general folktales so they feel like an odd inclusion to a story element that could've been handled in very different ways. But maybe they were intended to be explained further in future installments that will undoubtedly never come unless this thing gets cult classic status on DVD.",4
"  It's what you expect from a Guy Ritchie Interpretation of the King Arthur legend, namely, Lock Stock and King Arthur. I enjoyed it thoroughly, because I expected what I got. The critics seem to be upset this is not Shakespeare.",4
"  Stylised, plotless movie",2
  Best adaptation of the knights of the round table we've had in years!,5
"  This is one of the worst movies I've seen in recent years. It's a true abomination, should be killed an buried behind the shed. The one positive thing I can say about it: it was so bad it made me sign up for rotten tomatoes, just to post this review.",0
"  There are some good actors here. And they deserve better than this. 1,000 foot tall elephants. Bats the size of an airplane. Arthur fights a bear sized rat. Arthur commands a snake the size of a freight train with a head ass big as my house. Guy Ritchie tries to be 80% Zack Snyder and 20% Quinton Tarantino. Yet he's not as good as either. This movie was a disaster.",1
"  WTF did I just watch? Feels like Beowulf mixed in with The Great Wall, and elements of Snatch. Just one long confused mess.",1
"  This movie was AMAZING! ?? Charlie is such a wonderful actor! And absolutely gorgeous! He is so witty and humours, He definitely makes this movie amazing.",5
"  I rarely leave reviews for movies, but the critics got it wrong with this one. I thought it was a fresh perspective on an old story. Rodger Ebert needs to retire and shut up.",4
"  I don't see the problem critics had with this film. Sure, it's a CGI heavy movie with some severe liberties taken from the source material and some of the CGI is all that convincing, but this is what I wanted from a Guy Ritchie King Arthur, crazy camera work, intense fights, funny writing, solid acting. It's a great watch.",4
"  While critics hated it, I found it fun if ones into Guy Ritchie's movies.",5
  Criminally underrated filmThe shit reviews are deplorable,5
  Different version of King Arthur. As great effects and a lot action. Charlie Hunnan was great in it as King Arthur. If don't like director Guy Ritchie you may not like it.,4
  Great movie great special affects action packed very entertaining.,4
"  Arthur Pendragon with a fohawk? Seriously?! If that's not ridiculous enough, Guy Ritchie's excessive styling is obnoxious and disorienting when applied to this already convoluted and poorly explained take on the classic fable.",1
  Critics are out to lunch on this one. Very entertaining take on the old and previously pompously retold legend. Fun to see Ritchie's take on the noble but in a very ruffian way King Arthur.,5
  I want to see if it's that bad.,0
"  An enjoyable and different take on the King Arthur legend that I found fresh and different. The movie really takes off in the last 45 minutes or so. The 3D conversion was excellent. The score by Daniel Pemberton and is energetic, emotional and fresh score of any movie I've seen so far in 2017. Hope Richie makes another.",4
"  Brilliant movie. A perfect blend of action, mystery, suspense, comedy, and thriller",5
"  This a wonderful movie. It treats a legend just like what it is, a legend, with the right amount of fantasy, action and aventure to make it a King Arthur movie. The characters are on point, as are the actors and the special effects, and I have watched the movie two times already, prepared to watch it yet again. Great movie, despite what the critics say, and a great inspiration for the fans of fantasy and the Arthurian myths.",4
"  The biggest issue this film has and it is very obvious, the budget is massively over the top. Guy Richie should have stuck with the Holmes style for this film too, the best scenes are just the characters recalling a story, it felt like Lock stock and that is not a bad thing. The film falls apart when it uses all the CGI action and this is a bad oversight, Tarzan comes to mind here except that made money. The film needed to be more real with slight hints of magic, the budget and action scenes are just excessive, you might even ask the question of who this is actually marketed to. The great cast can only do so much and I'm shocked Richie was allowed to go over the top with the action scenes. The franchise should be resurrected with a lower budget and a non CGI tone, this tanked mainly because it was forced to the world as this weird Lord of the rings styled action film. The film is not bad and works very well, it just needed to focus on the real action instead of the weird mythology it created. 11-08-2017.",4
  This overall was a great action movie.,5
  THE worst movie ever made! Camelot meets London's East End meets lame video game graphics,0
"  Se me hizo sosa, nada empática, si matan a alguien te da igual, ni fu ni fa. mal editada, las cosas pasan de un momento a otro y ni sabes como llegó la gente ahí.",1
  Not big on modernization of classic tales. I get the impression the knights of the round table will have a Facebook group to stay in touch.,1
"  What the heck was that? A chance to make a beautiful, epic, movie. Instead an epic fail. Sometimes edgy, glorified badboy movies don't cut it.",2
"  Even with Guy Ritchie's unique direction, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword can't escape its bland origin story with less than impressive visuals.",2
"  Not without a spark and certainly it's a Guy Ritchie movie, but overall boring and unexciting in my eyes. Stopped watching after about two thirds of it.",2
  The critics were wrong about this one. It has its flaws but it was very entertaining and worth a watch.,4
  It was a really fun film that just came out too close to Guardians of the Galaxy.,5
"  Jesus, what poor editing to a movie. If Hollywood could stop ruining my favorite fairy tale and fantasy stories that would be great. Guy Ritchie, you have to make us care about the characters before we take us through some absurd training montage. The opening scene does nothing to setup your story, you put us into a room with people we don't know to give us a plot point we don't care about then you make us watch King Arthur grow from a boy, magically into a man and still we don't care about the characters. King Arthur pulls the sword out of the stone in Act One of this movie (not Act Three, like it should be) and from there... well I feel asleep after that. Hollywood, listen please, we need to care about the characters in a story before we can suspend our belief and surrender to the story. This movie is just like so many others which have taken a ""fresh"" approach to an old story. The best example of how not to do a remake is Tim Burton's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory. The fact that they just took one character and CGI duplicated that person made that movie unwatchable, but I am off topic now. My point is, I had high hope for this movie because I have always loved the story of King Arthur and the Knights of the Roundtable (hell even the table in the opening scene isn't round). This movie is barely watchable and I'm guessing by some of the reviews, most everyone agrees.",0
"  we found this flick thoroughly entertaining and well acted, although as many critics pointed out it isn't the ""traditional"" King Arthur tale.",5
"  Incredible cinematography Good Pacing. More action would have been fun. But when there is action, it's flipping perfect",4
  I enjoyed the humor and the new twist on an old story.,5
"  It was a fun and entertaining movie with great action. What I didn't like was that the scenes being very short and choppy. The dialogue was cheesy at certain moments and I thought the should have brought more character development for King Arthur and the side characters. Other than that, I thought it was entertaining and had great action with a truly evil villain.",0
  The critics are totally wrong on this one. It was a very entertaining retelling of the story,5
"  I loved this movie. It was fun, exciting and definitely different, which I liked. And if you've watched other Guy Ritchie movie then you are familiar with his story telling.",5
"  absolutely loved every minute of it, could tell it was a guy ritchie movie",5
"  It is a flawless movie! I don't know why the critics are so harsh but this movie deserve a great ""bend the knee"" respect. I hope we will get more from the Arthurian saga.",5
"  I liked it, kept you entertained. Some part was totally exaggerated, but hey most movies now a days can be unrealistic too.",4
"  I liked the movie, if you dont like it dont watch it.",4
"  As in typical Guy Ritchie fashion , solid cast catchy dialogue, great sound track and camera work. Thoroughly enjoyed the movie with the latest iteration of King Arthur Legend. This will be a hidden gem for many as critics sometimes forget movies are for entertainment and should be judged as such not all are going for Oscars.",4
"  This was a cool take on king Arthur, Guy Ritchie rocks",5
"  For me it was the best movie of 2017. Great scenes fights, nice speed in the storytelling, good characters and a new way to tell the king Arthur history.",5
"  Aside from earning points simply by being the most fantasy-driven, visually original, just-go-with-it King Arthur adaptation I've ever seen, I was (once again) glued to the screen due to Guy Ritchie's look-here-now-here-now-laugh-now-pay-attention-now-be-amazed-now-look-here style of directing. Mix that up with some great CGI work and some 'well THAT'S something new' fight scenes, and you've got an entertaining non-letdown of a film to watch tonight. I give it a solid A-.",4
"  Meh. Visually stunning, but the story was not too great. I wish the director would scrap the ""Sherlock"" style of directing. This movie felt too modern for what it was. Gives me HUGE doubts for my highly anticipated Aladdin live action. Let's hope for the best.",2
"  It is a great movie, the critics are wrong ! I can't wait for the extended version, I am certain it will be even better. The exit polls seem to be getting better as well, never take the so called critics at their word, you may miss out on a lot of fun !",5
  This movie was very good. I personally do not care if it followed the classic story.,5
  i already saw this movie a ok movie,0
"  They just did a King Arthur on a Guy Ritchie formula (fast paced, that Sherlock Holmes kinda theme) on this film. It didn't even worked out. Sorry I wanted to enjoy it at least but no it's not gonna work anymore. At least that last flop Dracula film is pretty entertaining than this. Not really a shitty film but they're trying too damn hard.. not gonna work.",2
"  Style, action, and story, I love this movie completely",5
"  It was a great flick all the way through. Amazing actors, a new hunk for me and a perfect classic story. It was even a bit funny and quite entertaining. I even loved the special effects and the creatures.",4
  This Movie suck it's only good when Charlie Hunnam in it =-= i was supposed to give 1.5 Star but got Charlie Hunnam in it .,2
  loved how this story was directed. great actors! Very entertaining.,5
  They eliminated Merlin and Guinevere - are you kidding me?? Big mistake! Gorgeous king with no love interest. A List actors but writing of this story was poorly done. Might as well have been a video game. Boring.,1
"  Just another garbage PC Hollywood production. The movie lacked character development and it could have had a better developed plot. If the producers and directors spent less time on the politically correct stuff, like adding African and Asian actors in a story where there were none, and focused more on the plot, the movie would have been better. It's like having a Chinese story from 500 years ago but the actors are of other ethnicity. First, Charlie Hunnam was a bad lead. His acting was horrible. Djimon Hounson is an awesome actor, but again, didn't fit in the story as a African man. Same goes for Tom Wu. While this movie is not a story of real events, King Arthur was real and 5th/6th century England didn't have Asians and Africans as knights. Again, this is garbage from Hollywood and SJW trying to rewrite history.",0
  very underrated movie very well done brilliant soundtrack watch it for your self,5
"  The Movie has a certain trashy vibe to it that makes it watchable, but nothing more.",2
"  This movie had some awesome Guy Ritchie flair. The story was pretty rad, the action was in full effect. My boyfriend and I really liked it! Thought it was pretty badass.",4
"  Awesome, gripping, not cheesy, and filled with good humor",5
"  If I only had one word to describe this movie, it would be - FUN! The visuals are insane, the music is on point and phenomenal, and the re-imagining of the tale of King Arthur is unique and makes for an interesting premise. It's almost more of an original story more than it is a movie about King Arthur. The CGI gets a little over-done [like in The Matrix Series] in 2 or 3 action scenes, but it's not enough to change the fact that this is a FUN movie that I'm glad I watched. If your in the mood for some care-free action bliss with AMAZING visuals, this is the movie for you! P.S. The cast they were able to pull together for this movie is really astounding - people from Game of thrones, Marco Polo, Sons of Anarchy, Gladiator... The list goes on and on!",4
"  This is a REALLY fun movie if your not too much of a stickler fro the actual King Arthur legend. The CGI is a little over-the-top [like the 3rd Matrix movie] in like 2 or 3 action scenes, but it wasn't enough for me to call this movie anything but FUN! IF you like action and just want to have a fun, carfree time, this is the movie for you! P.S. The cast they were able to pull together for this movie is crazy!",4
"  Pleasantly surprised, was better than I expected.",4
  very fun every scene so excite,5
  Nice Spin to King Arthur!,4
"  This was a great movie! I don't know how this movie didn't make more money in theatre's, I now wish I had seen this movie in the theater, we all missed out cause this would have been incredible in IMAX!!! But I've read they are supposed to do another 6 sequels or something like that, but even if they only do one sequel, I'll do something I've never done before, I'll wait in line at the IMAX just so I can be one of the first people to watch it!!!! If you haven't seen this movie yet, I strongly suggest you pay whatever you need to to see this amazing movie! And then go online everywhere you can and rave about how much you liked it cause if you don't show those people in movie land how much you enjoyed this movie, then there might not be any sequels at all!!! And that my friends would be a sad world for sure... I really hope they stick to their plans and produce many many many more of these, for years to come...",5
  Great update to an already overdone storyline.,4
  Not sure why people are hating on this movie. Loved it!,5
"  fantastic cinematography, well acted, thoroughly enjoyed this film!",5
"  this movie, simply put, is entertaining as hell, enjoy it for what it is.",0
"  Badass movie the up beat in the direction, the comic relief and the CGI was a perfect touch to a normally dull story.",5
"  The musical score is near perfection, so immersive into this film's world. Actors are spot on, giving it their all. Characters all got unique spunk and attitude to them. Effects are splendid. Fights are fast paced and epic. Only complaint is that some parts of the story are unnecessarily montaged through. All in all, critics tomato score is wrong, this is a fun movie.",4
"  An Awesome retelling of a ancient story, beautifully done and well directed. I loved every bit of it. Guy Richie should be commended for his excellent work.",5
"  be silenced 'TOP CRITICS' .. for those who paid the price of a ticket, we have spoken. FUN and great suits of armor were seen. Amazing camera work for medieval times. Guy Richie can come stay at my house for free.",4
"  Too much special effects for a classic story. The best in the movie, Jude Law.",2
"  This movie is great!! Guy Ritchie is fabulous. The movies plot was amazing and out of the normal, and that's what makes it great!!! Charlie was spectacular as Authur, and Jude Law was terrific. It's action packed and the story line is exciting and keeps you wanting to know the story more. Critics did a terrible job rating this movie. If you like Guy Ritchie movies you will love this.",5
"  I don't get it. I like Guy Ritchie's directing style. I am a fan of Arthurian legend. But putting the two of them together is like mixing hot chocolate and orange juice -- it just doesn't work. The movie undercuts any emotional impact it may have with its constant flashbacks and flashforwards. This movie may be fast-paced, action-packed and has some some fun visual effects, but it's still sadly one big mess.",1
  I dont understand why critics turn their nose up at such a good movie. I can understand that Guy Ritchie has a style that may not be for everyone. A must see for fans of Sword and Sorcery fantasy.,4
  Amazingly done! I fell in love with Hannum??! I don't understand why the critics didn't love it? It was bad ass,5
  Probably the worst movie I have seen in a decade. Begins with a nonsensical Lord of the Rings rip off and the plot and acting quality from there are dire. I hope this performance discourages Beckham from an acting career. Hunnam miscast and fails to dominate. He has a very wierd transatlantic accent which sounds rather wimpish.,1
"  Great movie! Shame to see such a disconnect between the critics and the audience. I loved this flashy, gritty, fast-paced and humorous take on an old tale. The style of storytelling amd narration, making copious use of flashbacks and flash forwards mixed with the aforementioned fast-paced editing and the snarky, dry british wit we'd expect from characters in a Ritchie film makes for a fantasy film that feels new and more engaging than the standard tropes we usually get when these types of stories are ""rehashed"" for the umpteenth time.The acting is solid all-round, with an exceptionally great performance by both Jude Law and Charlie Hunnam. The only exception is perhaps the Mage, who did not always come across as believable.The special effects were fantastic, with the sidenote that the Excalibur-driven action sequences felt very much like a ""video game cutscene"", which in and of itself isn't that bad - they were quite spectacular and visceral - but some folks might be put off by this style. One might wonder if the effects will hold up on subsequent rewatches some years in the future.That having been said, this film is definitely highly recommended if you are in to the idea of seeing Ritchie apply his style to the action fantasy genre - I believe he did a great job.",4
"  Good stylized action adventure movie, especially great fight scenes",5
"  For once Hollywood isn't rebooting an 80s classic. Here we have original plot, and fantastic visual effects. I'm not sure what the ""professional critics"" are thinking here but they're letting one fly under the radar.",5
"  I enjoyed this film and hope to see a squeal. The director did a fantastic job keeping the audience engaged. The fight scenes were a bit hard to follow due to the camera movement, but it was energetic.",4
  1 1/2 ud af 5 slagsværd. Guy Ritchie voldtager Arthur-myterne i en kaotisk togkollision af en freudiansk musikvideo på svampe.,1
  One of the best movies I have ever seen. For those who understand art of movies will only appreciate it.,0
  this movie deserve to be seen ....it wasnt commercialize properly if you are a fan of guy richtie you will enjoy it as i did ...,4
  Love it! Beautiful movie!,5
"  It may not be the original story, but which adaptation truly is? Guy Ritchie breathes new life into the legend, adding his own unique flair to it and imagining new things to incorporate, and what else is storytelling for? Charlie Hunnam is sincere in his role and plays a believably street tough Arthur who doesn't understand or want what he is destined for.",4
"  It's a flawed and fast paced movie, but it's an enjoyable fun film. B.",4
  Awesome movie. A great mixture of fantasy and action. Very well done. Once again rotten tomatoes is wrong.,5
  dope! Charlie Hunnam is the man and this was better then I had hoped,4
"  David Sims, Nico Lang,Peter Rainer, Peter Travers, Peter Travers, Katy Waldman and all the other critics. You wouldn't be able to recognize a good film if it come and hit you in the head.The Guy Ritchies direction it was perfect for a movie set in this fantastical era. The music of the movie was spot on. From the battle in the begging to other moments. Besides the old-fashioned cliche speech in the end at the 1 on 1 combat. The whole movie fantastic to say the least. The actors did an amazing job, given to them that they are good actors. The effects and CGI where spectacular. And the moments where they were obviously fake didn't matter honestly (Because I would expect a 8-foot demon double scythe wielding demon to look realistic).You critics, have the easiest job in the world. You do not excel in anything and all you do is talk about things that you couldn't do in 10 to 100 years. I have seen your reviews and like every other critic out there you are enjoying ""deep"" ""Wanna be"" ""new"" movies. Anything else besides the ""Deep"" moronic movies that you find good is not. But word to the wise when the audience has given 73% and you 28% just because you consider your selves critics with out a year of acting or directing or editing a movie you do not know what the fuck you are talking about and you are just plain wrong. But of course morons, like your selves will see this comment and disagree not because I am wrong. Because you and the other people who think they have what it takes to criticize a man that has been in the film industry for more than 20 years and he is considered one of the greatest directors out there from many actors, can't take no for an answer and if someone tells you are wrong. You just reply by saying ""that is your opinion"" or ""I am a critic what are you?"" or the far better from all that you believe ""I watch movies so I know"".Sincerely from all the people with brains that know that the mix of Guy ritchies directions in a fantasy movie was actually awesome, GO AND FUCK YOUR SELF THEN PICK A CHAIR UP PUT AND GO TO A BALCONY OR THE ROOF OF A BUILDING. STAND ON THAT CHAIR AND FALL HEAD FIRST FROM THE ROOF OR THE BALCONY. SO WE WON'T HAVE MORE ""WANNA BE"" PEOPLE WITH AN OPINION THAT HAS NO BASE ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE ON SOMETHING USING PRECIOUS OXYGEN AND SPACE ON THIS PLANET. Cunts!",5
  Awesome Movie! Critics suck! They prevented me from seeing this movie in the theatre. I loved it!,5
"  Despite all the bad criticism surrounding the movie, I think you need to see it before you pass on it, it's a great movie, more action and wonder than most king Arthur movie. The movie is a breath of fresh air.",4
  This is an amazing movie. Definitely a must see.,5
"  Once I stepped out of reality and sat back, I found this movie fun and exciting. The characters weren't cheesy,and the action was actually pretty good, overall it was just a good o'l fashion fantasy flick based on a old story.",4
  Intentando entender que quisiero hacer. Algunos recursos no funcionan cuando se trata de películas épicas. Dejalos para películas más contemporaneas,2
"  I enjoyed it.There were a few similarities to The Lord of the Rings, and you could tell it was a Guy Ritchie film but it wasn't bad.",4
"  This movie definitely doesn't do justice to this legendary classics.Totally not worth to watch,too ambitious for its kind.",1
  much much better than I expected. I wasn't going to watch it since it had bad critic reviews. I'm glad I ignored those reviews this time.,5
  Wow. Terrific. Almost didn't see it because of the critics - but it turned out to be one of the best movies since Guardians of the Galaxy 1.,5
"  This was surprisingly really good, loved the CGI, had a great 300 feel to it.",4
  Fantastic movie I'll see you at 500 more times great actors great story get me to watch it again,5
"  Firstly, this movie is full of witchcraft scenes and people from both the antagonist and protagonist sides have moments where they look like they're straight out possessed. Secondly, the rock music really takes away from this whole movie instead of adding to it. Thirdly, too much use of flash back method to tell the story. I would not recommend it and really would not recommend if you have kids because apart from everything else Jude Law's character kills both his wife and daughter for power in this movie.",0
"  I enjoyed this movie. I didn't see it in theaters when it initially came out because of lackluster reviews and there were other blockbuster films out that I wanted to see more. Honestly, this movie was very well done. Yes, it had it's shortcomings story wise and it skipped over things which would've been interesting to delve into while spending too much time on stuff not as important, but I enjoyed this movie and am glad I bought it. The characters were well done, the actors did a great job (there are so many great actors in this film...way more than were publicized), the director did some interesting things with an old legend. It had some of the best special effects i've seen in awhile and the fighting sequences with excalibur, coupled with the special effects, were flippin gorgeous to watch. This movie deserved way more than a 20ish something rotten tomato score. I would give it 4 stars easily, but i'm giving it 5 to balance out it's overall low score.",5
"  Another film ruined by Charlie Hunnam. Contrary to the media, David Beckham is about the best thing in this debacle.",1
"  RT missed this by a mile!! I don't know what the hollywood snob critics have against Guy Ritchie but the viewership feedback speaks for itself! This movie if fun, well acted, well shot etc etc WE LOVED IT!!",5
"  I loved this movie! I don't understand why ""the movie critics"" didn't like it but audience seems to. I liked the characters...I can see why the critics thought there wasn't enough character building but I thought it was enough to like the characters. It's definitely a fast paced Guy Richie style...which I thought was well done and I liked the symbolism throughout. This was suppose to be a series but not sure if it will since it didn't do well at the box office. Maybe he will get another shot and do more in the way of getting the audience to connect with the characters. I hope so...I would enjoy a series of these.",5
  Refreshing take on a classic tale,5
  Movie does not cater to the SJW cultwhich explains the difference in critics & audience score,5
"  An updated tale of the classic and very well done. In order to stay true to the classic to much wouldve been in the movie and taken away from the character build that one saw in not just the protagonist but jude laws adequate villain portrayal aswell. Actions scenes were well enough done to take me out of my CGI numbed coma and got me pumped. The story itself was your basic good against evil so the acting and humor needed to be gripping, which it was but i was more enthralled with the cinematography keeping each scene fresh with me. With that bring said this movie is generating some hatr and bad reviews on this site, so i guess im in the minority of people who loved it. This movie in its entirety just resonated with me and still lingers.",5
"  What's up with these critics? This movie is a great reimagining of the King Arthur tale. Great action, acting and eliciting directorial style. No excuse for the critics hating it. Fun to watch. the critics need to go back to watching Requiem for the Dead and LaLa Land and leave the good movies alone.",5
  I totally enjoyed this movie. I was a little hesitant as I didn't know what I was getting in to but I was glad to see Guy Ritchie's style come out in the movie. I found it to be a very fun and unique spin on the old and boring story.,0
  Kjempekul. Ble så positiv overrasket.,4
"  Really enjoyable, not for you if you want some traditionalist Arthur tale, but if you don't mind some Guy Ritchie fast cuts, narrative style and cheeky banter then this is the Arthur for you. It's fast paced, so try and keep up. Some of it borders on video-game-ish but it works. Watch it.",4
  This is a great movie- different style and humor than most people will like and new creative ideas - not a formula movie. Read IMDb reviews,4
"  I have too many words to say for how much I loved this movie to do it justice here; let's just say I'm not sure the critics saw the same movie as I. For the first time in over five years, I went to the theater to support a movie after nearly a year of hype (since seeing the Comic Con trailer), and I was not only impressed...I found a movie that is in my top two favorite movies of all time (fighting for first). If you are a fan of coming-of-age stories, the King Arthur legend, fantasy movies with fantastic set pieces, likeable characters, and awesome magic/fight scenes, or video games (particularly Shadow of Mordor), you owe it to yourself to see this and support well-made fantasy in a time when fantasy is not well loved by critics. My only two concerns for this movie were a) Hunnam is a ""hunk"" type of actor and I was concerned he wouldn't be able to pull off the protagonist role, and b) being rated PG-13, I worried the lack of blood would hamper the experience. I needn't have worried. Hunnam pulled off the part with perfect charm and charisma. In addition, the movie has plenty of moments that are emotionally effective and upsetting or brutal, and I don't feel an R rating would have changed the effect. In summary, nothing was missing here.King Arthur: Legend of the Sword was one of the most exciting experiences I've had watching a movie over the last nearly twenty years for me. I will support this franchise in any way I can in the future, and the husband and I supported it at the theater multiple times during its run. Highly, highly recommended. After having lost faith in movies years and years ago, King Arthur has made me fall in love all over again.",5
"  I loved it! This would also be great as a TV series on a station like HBO with this exact plot. Tons of action, intriguing wizards, evil that is also human. It's definitely worth a watch or two!",5
"  I am a huge die hard fan of King Arthur, his legends and stories. For years I felt sad that nobody has made a better movie than Excalibur. Also a film that was fast pase, hip, exciting and amazing. I went in expe ting to be let down by this film simply because I criticise all movies of King Arthur. This film however caught me off guard, the moment it started I was caught by it's style, speed and unique more magical take on it! By the middle of the movie I was smiling and loving all of it, when it finished all I could say was ""that was amazing!"" The movie got me hyper, excited and pumping on a rush. I never felt king Arthur was disrespected and love the chara yet development of everyone! Hands down my new favorite Arthur movie.CRITIC1. Did i enjoy the film? Yes2. Was the music good? Yes epic3. Was the acting good? Yes4. Was the action good? Yes5. Are the effects good? Yes6. Was the story line good? Yes7. Would you take a friend to see it again? Yes8. Did it have boring moments? No9. Was it everything you expected? Yes better10. Would you buy it to own? Yes",5
  Great movie!! I loved the storyline and the acting was on point.,5
"  Smart story with interesting plot turns and witty dialogue. Has that Sherlock Holmes quick storytelling and slow motion action scenes. Well worth seeing, I hope they can do the sequels.",4
"  I liked it, it was a typical Guy Ritchie movie. I can understand if you are a huge fan of the mythos, this would upset you.",5
"  great movie, worth it!!!",5
"  BAD BAD BAD. This is the kind of movie I try to avoid. You have a hero who keeps be force or seduced into submitting to witchcraft, and the evil uncle just goes about killing his own family to get the power he wants to some Female Jezebel Mind control squids that live in the sewers under the castle. It is full of snakes doing the biding and initiations to for evil and them destroying whole armies. It is dark and depressing and show the worst in going wrong for leadership and shows why England is a depressing place because this is King Arthur is there great story and mimics all the witchcraft that is in their history.",0
"  Peter Jackson's scale and Snyder's wet dream, Ritchie succeeds in dosing King Arthur with ecstasy and it's never been better. A rather strange combination of Ritchie's style/aesthetic with such a specific and confined lore sounded somewhat troubling, yet both compliment each other rather well. Ritchie's storytelling and edit work well within the story as does the lead Hunham, who is edging closer to being more and more comfortable in film. Law plays an equally as impressive villain in true over the top fashion. However, the over indulgence and reliance on CGI does tarnish what could've easily have been pratical effects",4
  Some people have the audacity to compare this to Zack Snyder's work.SHAME ON YOU!,1
"  Awesome movie! I don't know why the so called media ""critics"" have a problem with the movie. I can only presume it's a fake news story thought up by ""experts"" that cannot find their way out of a box. See the movie in theatres if you can and don't believe the hype of a bad start weekend the movie is a hit, It is exciting to watch, the fight scenes are incredible, and its quite enjoyable the way they created it.",5
"  I really enjoyed this movie. I had doubts because of the critics but I went to see it anyway, and I am so glad I did! Funny, engaging and very entertaining. I loved it and so did my 21 & 40 yr.old sisters and my 13 yr.old niece. I think the critics got it wrong with this one.",5
  The best king Arthur movie hands down!,5
"  At the cinema this week I also saw mindless, meaningless, video game-esque action for 2 hours, in the form of King Arthur Legend Of The Sword. I went in to King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword open-minded, but was disappointed. I can understand why critics are up in arms over this movie. King Arthur is a style over substance film; these films can be great if combined with some story-telling - but this film had very little. Lack of any meaningful character development in King Arthur meant that despite decent acting, I wasn't invested in the scraps of story. King Arthur's problems don't stop there: over-the-top, unrealistic violence undermines any sincerity this film had. It's a hot mess. As I said, King Arthur has decent acting and there's some clever film-making from Guy Ritchie in the transitions between time periods, but King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword had little else to offer. For a classic tale to be given this treatment is sad.",2
  King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is right up there with Amazing Spider-Man 2 as one of the worst big budget studio films I've ever seen.,1
"  Brilliant!! What's not to love? Especially King Arthur and his men chatting like ""London Gangsters"" priceless!! And oh Jax .....",5
"  Guy Ritchie takes his artistic style to a classic tale, returning it from the grave in which overtelling has buried it. Much in the way that Tin Man and other such productions put a drastic spin on an old story, this movie does exactly that. Look past the fact that this isn't the same story you've heard One Million and one times, and recognize the art and the beauty that Guy Ritchie and the entire development team brought to this story. Stunning imagery, beautiful characterization, and a marvelous cast really brings the viewer to the edge of their seat, and rivers one's eyes to the screen. OF COURSE THIS ISN'T YOUR FATHER'S KING ARTHUR, Welcome to the 21st century, boys and girls.",4
"  it's a good movie! mulai dari awal cerita yang menurut gua bikin kaget juga ya, karena terlalu cepat ke cerita langsung to the point. mungkin karena stok tampil ayahnya yang terbatas jadi langsung ke inti'a mungkin haha.. efek dan kamera movementnnya juga sadis, ditambah dengan sound yang amazing, dibumbui humor syegar sedikit demi sedikit. dan adegan sekilas david beckham juga akward dengan suaranya yang kek bocah itu dan ekpresi kagetketika arthur angkat pedang.",4
  one of the poorest directed movies I've seen in a long time,1
"  Great , Really fun exciting film. Guy Ritchie style is awesome and his dialogue is witty and keeps you wanting more. King Arthur Really keeps you entertained. Love how you just can't wait to see what he will do with the sword. Really awesome. Great acting.Hunman kicks ass. DONT LISTEN TO THE CRITICS AT ALLL. EVEN THESE TOP REVIEWERS. HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. Could have used more time to develop than end the story is the only gripe. I like my SUPERHERO KING ARTHUR.PLUS HIS Knights of the Round-table WAAAAY COOLER THAN THOR. !!!",5
"  This movie with the music and its scene cuts are amazing. Although the dialogues in the movie does not sync, overall this movie is awesome.loved it and i recommend everyone to watch this movie.",4
"  It was absolutely amazing. Besides the fact that it felt like a Guy Richie movie with the fast wit and intense action, it was an awesome movie all around.",5
  It's a more modern day version of King Arthur. Not terrible but wasn't fantastic either. Unfortunately everyone knows the story so it's overplayed and a lot of the classic story was left out.,2
  Loved it ?? funny! Well made movie. Wouldn't change a thing,4
  i really liked this movie there is very famouse story of king Arthur's and exhalibur and i think its good movie.,4
  I hate critics for downvoting this. This movie was awesome,5
"  Great, epic fantasy movie! Final confrontation looks like nothing else ever before, and by now is my fav. duel ever.",5
  Epic score. Great movie! Pitty the 'age old' critics couldn't grasp the fact that this story was modernized. Not sure they realize this movie was never meant for them...,5
  One of the worst movies I ever watched... the editing and pacing were very annoying. I did not care who die and live... this movie did not develop the relationships among the characters.,0
"  ""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is another dull historical epic that has nothing new to offer""Movie Review: King Arthur: Legend of the SwordDate Viewed: May 20 2017Directed By Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Sherlock Holmes, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, Snatch and The Man from U.N.C.L.E.)Screenplay By Guy Ritchie, Lionel Wigram, Joby Harold, Story By David Dobkin and Joby HaroldStarring: Charlie Hunnam, Jude Law, Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey, Djimon Hounsou, Aidan Gillen, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Craig McGinlay, Annabelle Wallis, Tom Wu, Neil Maskell, Freddie Fox and Eric Bana.There are no legends around here folks. ""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"" is another dull historical epic that has nothing new to offer. Okay there are giant elephants in the movie but did we already see them in ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King""? The problem with the movie is not stiff leading man Charlie Hunnam, it's the lone trigger-finger director known as Guy Ritchie. His filming techniques are nowhere to be found and plus his ""King Arthur"" is loud, bombastic and not very bright. Just like ""Robin Hood"", ""Tarzan"" or ""The Three Musketeers"", there have been dozens of variations of ""King Arthur"" over the years but all of them certainly weren't thrilling or engaging. I heard that Warner Bros. was looking at franchise potential for ""King Arthur"" but looking at those bleak box office results suggests that plans for a six-film franchise may not happen at all.""Legend of the Sword"" revolves around a skilled fighter and swordsman named Arthur (Hunnam) who runs the streets of Londinium. Back when he was a little baby, his father King Uther (Eric Bana) ruled England with a mighty fist until his treacherous brother, Vortigern (Jude Law) orchestrated a coup against him and seized his crown for himself. Oh yeah, Vortigern also sacrificed his wife to sea witches so that he could bring forth a demon knight to kill Uther and his wife. Arthur became the only survivor as he drifted away in a boat and he made his way to Londinium where he was raised by prostitutes.Meanwhile in Camelot, the evil mad-drunk known as Vortigren grows ever more powerful and he doesn't care if people hate him as long they fear him and his conquering rule. Suddenly, a mysterious, magic sword appears near Vortigren's castle and he commands the Blacklegs to pull out the sword from the stone it's stuck in. Everyone of them can't get it out except for Arthur who has no idea what his true identity is. It takes a long while but when Arthur pulls out the sword, he faints from the magic it contains. He later gets sent to the dungeon where he meets his treacherous uncle and he calls for his execution but he gets rescued by a mage (Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey) and Sir Bedivere (Djimon Hounsou) and his men.With his life turned upside down, Arthur is forced to face his heroic destiny and save the people of Camelot from the clutches of his evil uncle. This new ""King Arthur"" film has great locations and is competently put together but there isn't a whole lot to care for in this picture. Jude Law doesn't make for a convincing villain, the action feels relentlessly stale, the monsters are nonsensical and ridiculous and it has one of the most embarrassing celebrity cameos in recent memory.I'm not a fan of Guy Ritchie's movies but I don't hate him. He has a pure directing style but he just doesn't know how to use it well. And another thing, I don't want to see King Arthur being treated as a superhero. Can we just let King Arthur be King Arthur instead of having him be Thor with a magical sword? Guy Ritchie's ""King Arthur"" could've been a smashing success, it just needed significant changes to the script and remove ""Legend of the Sword"" from it's title.",2
  what a great movie def worth watching!!,5
"  Damn the critics and their snobbish attitude. Great film by Guy Ritchie. Looking forward to the sequel. I hope me makes a few. Also, amazing music.",4
"  Great action, loved it!",4
"  As a fan of the traditional stories I was interested in seeing this new take on an ancient historical fiction. I actually saw the film twice just in case I was being too hard on it. Personally I found the main character unlikable, the editing distracting and choppy, and the plot jumped all over the place. Our hero hits bottom like three times, which is great if we felt any change from him but ultimately he remains the same from start to finish with little to no development. If he was just going to stay the same cocky from-the-streets ""badass"" why put him through anything at all? I just didn't get the ""make it cool"" factor that everyone seemed to enjoy. Flicks like this you either love or hate and I was in the later camp. HOWEVER: It should be noted, that out of the six people I saw this with, I was the only one that didn't like it. They thought it was cool, quick, hard hitting and gritty. One patron in particular thoroughly enjoyed the underdog side of this story. If that sounds up your alley maybe check it out. I wouldn't pay a theater to see it again but maybe I'll rent it in a few months and try to lighten up.",2
  Was a bloody great movie I don't know what the hell Rotten Tomatoes is on about they always rate good movies trash and absoulete trash movies high was an honestly beautiful movie stunning visuals solid acting with a little comedy tossed in to sweeten the deal watch this movie!,5
"  This movie Killed it, if you were a ""Sons of Anarchy"" fan this is right down your ally",5
  Jacks needs to be reincarnated back to sons of Anarchy. He sucked big time in this movie.,0
  Not bad ?????????? ?????????? ?????? ???? ??????????? ???????? ??????? ?? ??????? ??? ????? ????? ???? ???????? ?????? ??? :D,2
  Charlie Hunnam was incredible in this movie! And the way King Arthur backstory was presented was one of a kind. One of the best movies I have seen this year!!!!,5
"  A mess of a film that just cant capitalize on a much loved name and keep it's audience attention. I got progressively confused at some point and had to start all over . Directors despite having a very linear storyline decided to twist things . Why show the light in the tower at the beginning when it made more sense to show as the film progressed. A movie with some of the best effects in 2017 was ruined by bad pacing, a tepid plot, unimaginative characters and terrible editing.",2
"  It was such a great movie..I already watched 3 times, will watch it again. One of the best movie of 2017.",5
"  Very well done. I regret not seeing it in theaters, but it was competing with a Marvel film and I'm vested in that franchise. I think the lack of critical reception shows how dated they are. It was a modern storytelling that had a deep moral display in the character evolution. The film tricks lent to the pace and I loved the video game like fight scene. Very impressed. New favorite film; and I'm a buff!",5
"  Great movie with great action I'm sure if I it had a female lead character most the crybaby critics would have loved it . The the movie was top notch with story, plot, cast, and action",5
"  How do you screw up a King Arthur story this badly? Ugh, I had high hopes for this film but it ended up being a slog to get through. Some good cinematography and imagery is it's only saving grace. Other wise a boring muddled mess of a film.",1
  Critics trash it but I though it was pretty damn good for a Guy Ritchie movie.,5
"  Legend of the sword was awesome, will watch again when avail for purchase.",5
  Awesome movie. A must see in theaters,5
"  Definitely worth the investment of time and money! Excellent, fun, exciting cast- Guy Ritchie antics that create a whirlwind of action and timeliness that brings you into the world of soon-to-be King Arthur. His direction and vision of a legend inthe making, comes through with visceral color! Charlie H. is excellent in his protrayal of King Arthur, along with a demonic Jude Law and very brief siting of Eric Baña (always a favorite). It seems poised to be followed by a few more journeys into this appealing, magic filled fantasyland- can't wait!",4
"  I went into the movie open minded, but hopeful. I was drawn in after just the first 5 minutes. I thought it was a great story and movie. Great action and graphics as well. I will be watching this one again for sure! ??",5
"  Really sad there will not be a sequel. It was very Guy Richie, which is always an intrigue. I can see why people had a problem with it. It is fast, in your face, and has a lot packed in it, but I enjoyed it for what it was and am sad there will be no others.",5
  I liked this movie was not what I expected. I would watch it again enjoyed it. Would like to see if they have a sequel ??????,4
"  Brilliant. Caters to those looking for something fresh, off the menu blend of cinematography & creativity. Definitely not your typical action film. No flying aliens, here.",5
"  Really love this movie,the soundtrack and the action i enjoy it fast pace story tellingGuy Ritchie Arthur is one of the best summer film i watch",5
  I liked slow time part when he held it with two hands,0
  Horrible fantasy twisted mess. Just another black arts disaster money wasted!! Spend your money else where than on this stupid plot and twist. Was a very watered down twist of a great legacy name. Definitely didn't give it anything to be proud of! Even made a mess of a good thing. Throw away your funding never make another thing except your bed. movie sucked!,1
  Last night I watched 'King Arthur: Legend of the Sword'. This was such an aggressively bad movie I could barely watch it. It was not just boring and tedious but irritating. The CGI based battle scenes were stupid while at the same insulting in the way they mindlessly copied scenes from Lord of the Rings. The only decent character was the bad guy played by Jude Law. I kept hoping he would somehow kill King Author and put me out of my misery.,1
  I liked the story and as usual Guy Ritchie does not disappoint,4
"  Not trying to take themselves too seriously. Worth watching, I personally enjoyed it.",0
  Had loads of fun! Make another one!,5
  I liked it despite all the critics,4
"  This movie was amazing!!!! Absolutely have to see Charlie Hunnam is so sexy and played this role like it was meant to be played. Showing King Arthur as a MAN not like a boy as he has portrayed in other movies. I will not spoil it, but this is worth every dollar spent had me on the edge of my seat the entire time!!!",5
"  I don't know why this movie has such a low score. The ""Critics Consensus"" may as well say ""We didn't like that they made King Arthur into a good movie.""Guy Ritchie did a fantastic job! Admittedly it opened really fast, but I believe his ""hit the ground running"" method of story-telling set the pace for the rest of the movie. I'd compare the pace with the likes of Interstellar, or Inception.From the moment they introduced his character, I quickly admired King Arthur as a hero, and as a person. Charlie Hunnam's King Arthur was complex, yet simple. A true hero, but a believable character.I don't agree with the critics that this movie ""...wipes out much of what made it a classic story in the first place"". I think the very opposite. I like the new twist on the old legend. There's no reason to write a purists review about the Arthurian Legend. Nothing about the Arthurian Legends is historically accurate in the first place.P.S. I read some of the individual reviews from the ""Top Reviewers"". I'd have to say that their reviews are just as empty as they claim this movie to be.",4
"  Guy Richie does it again. Extremely entertaining movie. Is it absolutely perfect? No. But I will still be rewatching it multiple times. The soundtrack is spectacular, perfect song choice, perfect timing, perfect mood.For those people complaining it's a crappy movie because Richie veered off the original story, get over it. You will actually enjoy the movie if you aren't so afraid of change.",4
"  The best of the proposal presented by Guy Ritchie, is in total unpretentiousness and unconcern with the lovers or idolaters of the classic tales connected to the medieval universe of King Arthur, it is evident his desire to present a story that talks to the present times, mainly in creating a Blockbuster that meets the wishes of a young audience, arousing in this same audience, the interest in following a new film franchise. Guy ambitiously interweaves the interests of a major studio production, a visual quality and narrative characteristics characteristic of the director. In summary, a film with artistic and commercial pretensions, and that manages to fail in both aspects, which perhaps has generated so many negative critics, but that make ""King Arthur"" a curious case to be observed and that already it is worth giving that conferred in the movie. Highlight the ""hip-hop montage"" that portrays the advance of childhood to the adulthood of King Arthur, a work exquisite and characteristic of Guy Ritchie's accelerated montage.Guy Ritchie is an English filmmaker who caught the attention of many in 1998 with the release of his second film ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". It is evident in this work, marks that have become singular to the style of Guy, and that consequently they are present in ""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"", like an edition of abrupt images, with cuts dry, fast the frantic use of the images And which are expressed by the use of a very punctual camera whose plans are governed in large part by the editing and counting on a movement of camera and plans as the characters advance, that is, a perspective of following, the follow of a point To the other. A bold language, very similar to that of video clips and videogames, which at the same time generates a contradictory duality in ""King Arthur"", because, at the same time, it is interesting and different to have a medieval history, which has already been told and retold so many times and In such close ways, here, in Guy's film, it is more remodeled.To reshape this history, the director renounces any literary pricelessness or of an untouchable character in the face of a secular history, on the contrary, he modernizes it and expresses it in several scopes, in the costume, for example, uses the resource of timeless fashion, From modernization to garments, creating lightness and mobility to aid in the action scenes, our King Arthur is now a man who exhibits the features of his body wearing shirts that show off his pectoral heals. The soundtrack is a separate show, signed by Daniel Pemberton and featuring songs ranging from Led Zeppelin's ""Babe I'm Gonna Leave You"", blending classic musical styles of Nordic culture, troubadours, polyphonic music with Organon's and with own compositions and an incidental track full of serious sounds, references to heavy metal that resembles something of ""Mad Max"" and mainly by the insertion of a sound, that in the film mixes to the roar of elephants and its effect of horns and To ""BRAAAM"", created by Mike Zarin for the movie ""Inception"" and which has become a fever and almost obligatory resource for action films, suspense and epic traits.Of course, this modernity expresses itself in all the sectors that comprise a film, they become even more striking in the direction and the photograph, precisely in both sectors where the film more slides and makes its mistakes. In the quest to modernize ""Arthur"", Guy reshapes this classic story in the style of games, but forgets the crucial appeal of games, where the audience is at the same time, spectator more active player of the game, already in the movie, we are full load That this exerts spectators, therefore, in scenes like the escape of King Arthur and his companions, in which Ritchie inserts a subjective camera and the molds of those mini-sports cameras and coupled in the lateral (shoulder), of the actors, capturing a Image of escape common to the consoles and that also gave fame to the film ""The Hurt Locker"", 2008, however, when presenting in this unique moment of the film, they explain the character of artificial use and of excess in King Arthur, both generating moments Embarrassing as in the final sequence, where ""Arthur"" (Charlie Hunnam) fights against the army of his uncle ""Vortigern"" (Jude Law), instead of a choreography or any other possibility of real fight, we have a cheap insertion of graphic S 2D very poorly performed and that generate shame, since this is the great moment of clash and the summit that the script tirelessly points out, mainly because the scenes of fights never to be realized effectively.The film already begins with an interesting prologue that unites a brief explanation of facts important and necessary for the knowledge and later understanding of the public, and also introduces some characters, the best known of Arturian mythology (Merlin, Lady of the Lake and Mordred), That during the film are mentioned and reappear in winks, in the clear interest of the franchise of the film, since he originally the idea is of counting on six productions. Finally, in this prologue where the great battle of Uther Pendragon (Eric Bana), Arthur's father and king of Britain against Mordred (Rob Knighton), the traitor of the King and of the people, is drawn in this whole Mise- En-scene of great confrontation is established as the initial apex, the problem is that it does not happen, the goodwill of the public can be seen as a way to signal the greatness of King Uther, who prefers to surrender to the confrontation, sparing his army and People, but these interruptions of battle occur at all times in the film, they are strategically presented but never staged by a question of direction, which always remains in a negation, either by non-physical attainment to the detriment of a graphic realization or by Other issues that would make this moment unfeasible, although they are strange in view of the budget dimension and the indications of the script.Computer graphics is another interesting aspect in ""King"", often assuming the direction of the film, because in the great scenes of fight or combat, important and expected scenes with expectations of the fans of this genre, since they are characteristic marks of epic films And action, as well, they are given to computer graphics, which is largely done in a masterly way, but which questions Guy's limits and ability as a director, even in Guy's most striking feature of technical virtuosity, are Now assumed by the graphic resource and exploited in too much time and narrative appeal that only generate confusion, tiredness and again the superficiality strikingly employed to the film, result even in the performances governed by stereotyped constructions. Jude Law as Vortigern, bordering on the infantile of a villain who can not be justified, his ambition, his motivations and vilanias are weaker, compared to a villain of drawing, for all that Vortigern does is about an action punctuated only by doing, Something that so little Charlie Hunnam achieves with his King Arthur, the charisma of the actor is notorious and his effort is visible, but useless before the superficiality of a character and a story that turns out to be more fantasy.""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"" in trying to be modern gets lost in its own fragmented virtue, generating a fantasy film without trace of wanting to be history, even though it is based on one (for a very rich sign), and ends up generating a product without Focus, but that shoots to all sides and doubting the explicit desire of its end, to stimulate the public to follow the next stories that will come from this franchise, since the inability to stick to the original idea, to tell the legend of the sword Of King Arthur, who ends up being portrayed soon, giving space to a script that turns on an enclosed mission that does not need and does not want to tell any more.",2
  FINALLY a great modern fantasy done right loved it and will watch it over and over again,5
"  Great action, comedy, thriller, drama. I highly recommend this movie. Very very underrated!",5
  It gives an old tale a very modern direction that refreshes the history and make you watch more about this character.,5
  need more of these. missed merlin but great overall!!,4
"  Loved it, visually appealing and defiantly more of the type of role I like to see Charlie play. You could feel the Guy Richie touch. Which I enjoy. I will see it again down the line!",4
  The soundtrack is amazing. The script was clever and the pacing quick and easy to follow. The way the action scenes were shot was intriguing. I really loved this film. It was definitely refreshing after all the superhero movies that have bogged us down with expectations. I wish more people had given King Arthur a chance.,5
  I can't wait for May 12th!!!!,4
  Worst King Arthur movie of all time,1
"  Just goes to show you don't listen to the 'up their own arse' critics. Highly entertaining, great visual effects,a fresh take on a stale tale. Sure you can pick holes in it but if you want a good,exciting fun movie,i'd give it a serious go.",5
  This movie was not the same old story line they switched up the storyline they have great specials effects it was like a mixture of king Arthur and him being abandoned and having like a Robin Hood type feel to it railing against a power hungry king that' sacrificed his more treasured things for power from a demon,4
"  really good King Arthur, I don't understand the negative reviews from the shitty ""critics""",4
  no coherent story line. Super CGI but woeful adhesion of story. All over the place with good actors,1
"  King Arthur turns into King ""Boredom"" With cheap effects rivaling cheap acting in a non-stop , rushed, jumbled together plot that will leave you wondering ""Whats going on?"" Your better off watching the Disney version",2
"  Very entertaining!! Lots of action, humor, great cast. Well spent 2 hours.",5
  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The critics should realize this is a fantasy movie not a boring age--old-tale told many times.,5
  The critics are wrong about this one. If you don't see this one you're missing out.,5
"  When style is more important than story, you get a well presented pyle of crap.",1
"  This movie is filled with so many unnecessary scenes. Some parts could be cut off and it wouldn't matter. Actor tries his best to do the whole raised on the street vibes through his version of King Arthur. Frankly, I didn't see it.",1
  i dont care what people think :) i like the movie very much seen it 2 times already would like to go again :),5
  I liked it totally different from the normal king aurthurs they put out.,5
  Good Movie!! Great set up for a sequel!,4
  Loved how the film was shot. Very creative.,5
  how they took such great story and turned it to this..........sad,1
"  For fans of Guy Ritchie, and sword and sorcery, this movie is fantastic combination of the two. I went in to it with hopeful, yet low expectations after seeing reviews. Walked out with a new movie to add to my favorites list. May not be for everyone, but I absolutely loved it.",4
"  Apparently, the audience including myself really liked it, and I don't understand what the 'critics' beef is with this film? After all, it's not really detailing true events in history and what made this a 'classic story in the first place' is based on details which mainly consist of ""folklore and literary invention, and [Arthur's] historical existence is debated and disputed by modern historians"" as a quick Wikipedia search (with proper references) would prove. Solid 5 stars from me!",5
  Guy Ritchie doing his thing. Great movie!,5
  very well done retelling of the old tale!,5
"  Classic Guy Ritchie movie - fun, exciting and amusing characters.",4
"  once you get past the plot being shaky, this movie was amazing!!!!!",4
  Yeah this movie is AWESOME! EVERYTHING ANYONE COULD EVER WANT TO SEE IN A MOVIE. This movie must have pissed someone off to have the critic reviews be so bad. But honestly WELL DONE! FIRST TIME IN ALONG TIME i didnt feel my money was wasted!,5
"  I added extra half star just for the totally awesome soundtrack, too bad the movie itself was such a horrible mess with so many things crammed in there, it would be enough for 3 more movies. Ugh.",1
  I saw King Arthur: Legend of the Sword and I knew it was going to be good.,5
"  We really enjoyed this movie. Great fun, entertaining and funny!",5
"  I need King Arthur part 2 please. Awesome movie. Forget the critics, this is a great movie to watch.",5
"  La primera parte es entretenida y pasable, lleva toda la marca de Ritchie, pero la segunda mitad es aburrida e increíblemente tonta, el papel de Law da vergüenza y la historia es todo un novelón sin sentido.",2
  Critics are dumb. This movie is phenomenally entertaining.,5
  Good film. Mix between lock stock n two smoking barrels and lord of the rings,5
  2 hours of my life I will never get back,2
"  I thought this movie was awesome! You can't take what critics say with a grain of salt; most of them will give a horrible movie 7 to 8 out of 10, while leaving the movies worth seeing in the dark! I suggest anyone to see it, and criticize it yourself.",5
"  I usually like Guy, but honestly... what a gong show. The source material feels defiled by the needless inclusion of black and Asian characters seemingly for the sake of diversity quotas. The setting is Medieval England; would it make sense to add white people to movies about Admiral Yi Soon Shin?The film in general feels historically confused. Medieval Englishmen using the word 'celebrity' and the antagonist and some others being dressed in what looks like modern clothing.Worse, despite the, hm, ""artistic liberties"", the movie is as cliche as you could expect it to be. The villain and his men wear black, and for that matter the villain in his bad guy haircut gives a monologue about fear. The film truly does come across as Revolution Film #7352. Additionally most of the plot elements are predictable- so much so that I actually called a large number of them.In short the film is a good one for those that hate the King Arthur mythos.",1
"  This movie was Solomon Kane meets 300. If you liked either of those movies I suspect you will enjoy this one as well. Some of the camera scenes were annoying but overall the pace was decent, the action good, and I liked the twist on the arthur legend.",5
"  This Version of King Arthur is absolutely terrible. To much going on, terrible graphics, and poor story line. Its sad, because the actors did such a good job with such poor product. Sadly disappointed. It takes a lot to disappoint me.",0
"  Great film, if you're a normal person who enjoys a good action or comedy you'll enjoy this. If you're a snooty film critic more focused on nitpicking then stay clear.",4
  King Arthur: Legend of the Sword tries to take the age-old tale and update with modern action scenes and Ritchie's style but they do not match at all.,1
  It was a great twist to a classic really enjoyed it.,4
"  This story is well known because it's over told. Woe betide the one who dares to update the thing! Yes, this is not your daddy's King Arthur, and thank goodness. Ritchie raises this bad boy up from the grave and instills the sucker with sweet life, and makes it a bad boy all over again. Jude Law is mad impressive. Charlie Hunnam makes relatable the whole ""I-don't-wanna-be-king-but-watch-out-if-I-do"" dynamic. Just as good of a film as it's forebears, The Adventures of Robin Hood"" and ""Excalibur"" and worthy of that prestigious canon. Time will prove this one out.",5
"  Its laddish approach,has Guy Ritchie written right through it,and it's entirely too modern with regard to language and the script is definitely not top drawer...yet,with it's refreshingly original reimagining and great special effects,it's a massively enjoyable top notch thrilling feast for the eyes...I liked it a lot...Boy Fest.",4
"  Too me at least its not as bad as the critics make out. I found it entertaining. I was in the mood for an action flick with a fantasy feel and this fit the bill nicely. Its nicked bits from quite alot of other sword, fantasy films but hey it didn't bother me. I found the use of london accents amusing and enjoyed more of the movies scenes than i didn't enjoy. Looking forward to more.",4
"  I sat there staring at the screen for the first ten minutes, wandering if the insanity on the screen was going to stop. However, after a while I started to enjoy the modern twist, and became quite involved with the characters. It is easy to see why this would not be everyones cup of tea, but who wants another boring take on the classic? Ritchie did the exact opposite, and for that he gets a thumbs up from me.",4
"  Awesome movie, really hoping they make sequels to it",5
  Great movie and acting,4
"  Yet another case of the critics getting it wrong. I don't know if they are out of touch with the general public or what, but whenever they disagree with user scores, I go with the user scores and find them to be more accurate.I think many of the ""professional"" critics are going the way of fake news outlets. We the public don't think like you, we don't trust you, and we don't believe you. I liked this movie. I'm not concerned with the cr*p that the critics are, I just wanted to be entertained, and I was. End of story...",5
"  I am having problems seeing why this has a 28% rotten and a 74% like it rating. Has rotten tomatoes completely lost touch with its base. This was a great movie. It had all the components of success. Great acting, awesome special effects, an original story. A great take on the story of King Arthur, which i would like to add contrary to many on here has many parts of the myth in it. I am at a loss. Compared to Wonder Woman this movies kicked ass.",4
  This is the best version of King Arthur I have seen in the past 25 plus years.......and trust me they have made a few. Unless you have a remake of the old Disney version this film takes the cake. Keep up the good work Guy Ritchie!!,5
  I enjoyed this film and if you like guys films you will enjoy this one.,4
"  This movie was very pleasant surprise. It was one of the better fantasy films ive seen in a while. Both the comedy and drama were well timed, the action was abundant, the story telling was unique..but very ""guy richie"". I found that i cared for the characters. based on our current box office choices, this is one of the better ones. It accomplished what it intended to accomplish. The only real significant immersion breaker, was our fearless heros english accent.... he really tried but it would have been better if he didnt. That being said, its by no means a deal breaker. Dont watch it at full price, wait until it hits the discout theatres. But i would reccomend the big screan for this one!!",4
"  Besides from a few humorous moments from Guy Ritchie & Charlie Hunham, this film lacks the intelligence & true wit to pull off this CGI ridden trash.",1
"  I thought it was fun...think it looked beautiful. Loved the humour in it (even though I'm the only one in the theatre that got the jokes). Soundtrack top-notch too.The scene with the Lady in the Lake was breathtaking-the wide shot was so beautiful I actually said 'Wow' out loud.Just wish the giant elephants and snakes were more realistic. It did remind me of 300 or The Hobbit in that regard, other than that I really loved it. Charlie Hunnam was perfect in the role. Tons of action, no stupid romance thrown in. Fun!",4
"  Screw the critics, this was a fun movie and I enjoyed the different story and the guy richie style. From the scene a few minutes in at the brothel (the story telling style that is pure guy richie)I knew this movie would rock and it did.",4
"  It comes always to the personal opinion of everyone if he ether likes or not a movie. Personally i loved Charlie Hunnam how he played the Arthur role, so i do not always look at rating and then decide if i watch the movie. There are movies out there that got 100% but i can't understand how they got this high rating. In other words you have to watch a movie and then criticize it.",4
  It was a very great movie.I'm tired of people just listening to out of touch critics. Especially the people that just read the said critics reviews and just duplicate exactly what their review states while most likely never even taking the time to watch the movie.I gave it 5 stars because I believe it was a great reimagining King Arthur. And it's directed by Guy Ritchie I mean the guys a badass with such good vision look what he did with Sherlock Holmes probably a couple of the best films from the past decade.If you want to sit down and watch a great movie with a great story----- Watch It!!!!,5
  Honestly I went in expecting a terrible movie based on critics and this website but honestly the critics could not be more wrong. This movie painted one of the most interesting cinematic worlds I have seen in a while. It's unique it's exciting and all around incredible. Highly recommend it. With all these amazing futuristic movies coming out this is the first fantasy movie that is either on par with their quality.,5
"  bad acting, mixed with weak story telling, painful edit cuts, literally painfully went through some of these exhibition scenes. uninteresting and unoriginal trannabe franchise that I hope will never see the light again.",0
  It was one beautifully shot MESS.,2
"  loved it, the action sequences were amazing and the overall storytelling was good. most of all I love the cinematography",4
"  This movie was exactly what I wanted to see! Lots of action and a storyline that although does not match the accepted legend still works in the rendition. If you are looking for an action movie, this is it.",0
  King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is an excellent introduction into what shall be a long running series of films based around King Arthur and his Camelot. Don't believe any of the negativity of this film. The film was a thrilling ride from start to end. Armchair critics will become a thing of the past just like Excalibur cutting through the iron shields of soldiers who dare stand in the way. Keep your eyes on yong Arthur and let him take you to new heights you never dreamed of.,4
"  Best movie I watched in a long long time! Editing is amazing! Fast paced, exciting, best visual effects, great acting, witty, fluid scrip! Love how the story is able to cover so much detail in quick shots. If you like game of thrones you'd love this. I am giving this review as I am shocked at the tomatoer reviews! Who are these people? It's clear they don't know a good movie when they see it! This is not meant to be a copy of the original story and should not be judged on that. This movie deserves an oscar for editing. A must see! Love this film.",5
  very good movie just released at the wrong time,5
"  A retelling of the classic story of The Sword in the Stone ends up being a decent film even if it isn't a King Arthur film. Guy Ritchie shows again that's he's more style over substance. His films always look cool, but never really tell a coherent plot. Charlie Hunman does an admirable job and he does give the film some type of character development. Jude Law was actually pretty good not to say he isn't a good actor because he is . It just most of the time these fantasy villains come off being annoying and yelling all the time demanding attention and power. I also chuckled seeing Aidan Gillen and Michael McElhatton in the film being a huge Game of Thrones fan. I can't say I wasn't entertained because I was, but when it comes to a film it lacks and I can see why this movie flopped. 55/100",2
  A great movie experience!,5
  Zero character development. Only plot,1
"  I absolutely loved this movie! It delivers information in much the same way as Guy Richie's Sherlock Holmes, a technique which I am fascinated and enraptured by. The visuals are stunning, if not a bit quick at some moments. Another thing that had me chomping at the bits was the soundtrack! Holly cow it is amazing. People take for granted what a quality soundtrack can do for story telling. This movie had me laughing and sitting at the edge of my seat at all the right moments. Now for the long part... A lot of people complain that the movie does not accurately depict the legend, but the thing is, IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A CARBON COPY! Do you have any idea how boring that would be??? It's a movie for heaven's sake, made to be entertaining not necessarily historical. People had the same problem with ""God's of Egypt"", yet another underrated film-and this is coming from a real ancient Egypt enthusiast. In other words, enjoy the movie for what it is. If you want something historically accurate then go read a text book!",5
"  0 Stars! This convoluted mess of a film wants to rewrite the Arthurian legend, only it doesn't know if it wants to be a caper, a war resistance story, or an anachronistic gangster tale. terrible edits and complete fails of logic at various points. Not worth your time.",0
"  I loved it. It was different, it was Guy Ritchie at his best. Great dialog, great story, great magic. I don't know what the hell is wrong with critics, but I've already known never to listen to them!",5
"  Best King Arthur movie ....good soundtracks, great cast, no romance kind.",5
  Ok movie. messed up on some if the CGI. Ok to watch. Wonder Woman and Guardians of the Galaxy is a better watch.,2
"  Beautiful, action packed movie with a soundtrack that blew me away. Actions scenes are directed in such a way that you feel the power of the sword and it's breathtaking. Definitely recommended for everyone interested in kdark fantasy. Although it doesn't keep too many things from original story I didn't have any problems with that.",4
  The only telling of the story worth watching.. Of course if you want to cuddle up to Richard Gere 'Pretty woman' is a great flick and obviously what some of these reviewers were expecting.,5
  Great movie and effect are pretty amazing.One of my favorite movies. Highly recommend it,4
"  Don't mind the critics. The Users have it correct. This is an amazing story, well told by one of the best directors of our day. Visionary blending of myth, legend and historical fiction into a contemporary tale. Blown away. Way better than I expected. 5 Stars.",5
  Super fun fast paced movie Must see,5
"  Critics can say all they want about the original story. King Arthur can be remade, just like they remake the Justice League or any of the Batmans. It was a solid movie, great music, beautiful costumes and sceneries, and lets face it gorgeous cast. Everything I want to go to the cinema and come out saying ""wow! Im glad I paid to come see this."" Shame of the coming out time, should have made a killing.",5
  while taking great liberties with the story it's still very entertaining.,4
"  Love the movie, do not understad The critics how can they hate this movie and love wonder woman, really dont get it",4
"  Not sure why this wasn't bigger. Have to admit I groaned when I saw the trailers thinking ""Here we go again, another King Arthur tale."" Then I saw it at the cheap theater and loved it! It is going to be in my top 10 for the year probably.",4
"  Ignore the negative reviews from picky people - this is a good, fun adventure movie.I hope they make more.",4
  show sucked. man it was terrible,0
"  Outstanding Entertainment. New cinematic styles with nods to English literature. Jax Teller was not in this show, that was Arthur, King of the Britains.",5
  This movie delightful. Don't listen to others and go have fun with Ritchie's King Arthur,5
"  King Arthur: Legend of the Sword has MAAAAAGIC. Like, REALLY GOOD magic. AMAZING magic! And the visual storytelling in the beginning is very good. You understand how some things work early on without needing a while lot of verbal explanation, and I thought the early editing was strong. There is a montage early on that made me think, ""Hey! THIS is how you do a montage!""And then Charlie Hunnam wakes up, takes a breath and soon after speaks a line of dialogue.King Arthur: Legend of the Sword suffers from two main problems: acting and editing.The characters themselves are interesting and the script does well enough to move things along, but everyone here on the good guy side is saying stuff on a flat note and going about things without a sense of urgency. Hunnam is not great, and he totally fails in selling that he's a King Arthur in hiding, but outside of Jude Law, he's giving one of the better performances. Girl who plays Queen Amidala - I MEAN Guinivere, I think, she's the hero sorceress - she gives her lines in a monotonous, robotic tone that feels really weird. They also chose a pretty bad child actor to play a crucial part in the film.Jude Law here is fun. Ironically he's guilty of the worst acting moment in this film, but outside of that he's enjoyable outside of the moments he's sitting around, and he sells that he's not someone you want to cross in a dark alley. Seriously, he looks like a guy who would kill you for beating him out for a job at Krispy Kreme. The rapid-fire editing loses its charm after the prologue, and some of the action is in view, but I still felt like my eyes were being jerked around during the close-quarters combat scenes.Guy Ritchie's camera angles brought a little bit of his style to the closing sequences, but that in a way made the editing feel inconsistent.The third-fourth of this movie where they shift away from the more fantastical locations and back to the city introduced in the movie felt very bland in comparison to the other parts, even though there were some exciting monents, some attempts at humor and charisma and one major development (which I didn't quite believe the thing that triggers the development because it features two characters who didn't have that much development with each other, BUT I DIGRESS). This part of the movie also features the heaviest edited action and centers on characters that the movie thinks it's gotten you to care about...but I absolutely didn't. Throw in the fact that Law's character arc gets recycled as far as emotional impact is concerned, and a lot of interesting female parts get left in the dust for a bunch of boring dudes, and you have yourself a rather flawed adventure with sorry acting that is high-energy, starts off extremely promising and is sometimes beautiful to look at but then other times hard to follow because of the editing.King Arthur: Legend of the Sword gets a 5.6 and is One-Watch Worthy.",2
"  I enjoyed King Arthur: Legend of the Sword in 3-D which opens with a lengthy and spectacular prologue in which Camelot, the fabled stronghold of Arthurian legend is under siege by dark wizards riding enormous, battle-ready elephants. I was a bit confused in the beginning until I realized we are witnessing the results of a struggle for power between Uther Pendragon (Eric Bana) and his brother Vortigern. (Jude Law)The story of King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is a combination of reality and folklore. The basic plot tells us the story of jealousy and desire for power. Before he dies, Uther sets his son adrift on a boat. Vortigern is king and he rules ruthlessly and fails to remember the law of cause and effect. The young child Arthur (Charlie Hunnam) raised in a brothel. He grows up in back alleys of the city and becomes a strong and capable man. He is not aware of his birthright, but once he pulls the sword from the stone, he is forced to face his true legacy- whether he likes it or not. Forced to make up his mind, he joins the rebellion along with the mysterious Mage(Astrid Bergès-Frisbey) as he learns to use the power of the sword to defeat the dictator Vortigern, his uncle who murdered his parents and stole his crown. King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, an adventure and fantasy comes with vivid computer graphics and thundering sounds. I like the way the story uses flash backs to bring you up to date on the story. It is exciting and an entertaining film. It references prostitution and female breast nudity along with the people wounded and killed with swords, knives and arrows. I recommend the film for ages 13 and some adults will enjoy it also. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars. Reviewed by Juanita L. KIDS FIRST! Juror. For more reviews, visit kidsfirst dot org.",4
"  Amazing amazing movie. Shocked by the critic reviews. Definitely THE most underrated movie of ALL TIME. Amazing visuals, BRILLIANT score, even the acting. Epic, epic epic movie, loved it. Deserved much much more.",5
  I thought this move was great! Who TF is watching these movies!?lol,5
"  Look, just forget the fact that t hey grab a few historical characters and completely get them wrong, both in character, sequence and just about anything else. This is just a rollicking good yarn and I loved it. I w as nearly put off by t he bad reviews, I am so glad I ignored them. This film is pure escapism and a great way to spend a few hours",5
  Not the greatest movie but excellent performances from Charlie Hunnam and Jude Law.,4
"  Great movie, very entertaining.",4
"  Enjoyed this, DB makes this with his cameo ;)",4
  I really liked it the action with the special effects it just kept me excited through the end.,4
  Great movie. The critics are wrong once again.,4
"  Brilliant movie the editing and pace of the movie made it refreshing to watch and despite the athurian ledgers being evolved, the original concept still stands as the ledgend of athur itself is highly evolved too, so it doesn't seem bad that the plot was evolved from the legend . This movie was well done despite its extra large budget. I recommend as for once it's something new and non idealistic.",5
"  great from Ritchie, his style as always.",4
  I loved it so much. Way to go Guy Ritchie and Charlie Hunnam.,5
  movie was ok once i realized it was going to be on the lines of like a knights tale,4
"  Fun, fast, energic! Great movie!",5
  Enjoyed every minute of it. Hope the franchise continues,5
"  The Main Actor is very good in SONS OF ANARCHY and I bet you he will do a fantastic job in this. If I don't get the chance to see it in theatres, Never Mind, I'll find it on DVD, It's just a movie.",0
"  Awesome! I have no idea why it got bad reviews other than it was a fantasy done in a modern genre and people don't like change. Totally fun, visually epic, and very modern. Highly recommend!!",5
"  So much of this movie is interesting and original, including its camera angles and ""fast forward"" approach to working through character history. The acting is also solid. It simply didn't take itself a seriously as it might have. King Arthur felt more comic book-ish than a great mythological symbol, which is more appropriate. The choice seems to have been to direct this toward early teens, and so, the rest of us were deprived of what could have been really cool.",2
  my mom thinks I'm a LEGEND,5
"  I must be one of the rare people who actually LOVED this movie - it was intense, engaging, and I was sucked right into the story. I loved Guy Ritchie's presentation about the passage of time, such as the development of Arthur's' character through childhood, that was all we needed as an audience to understand his motivations and behaviours at the time of the story. Awakening to my being in the cinema was very surreal, having become so engrossed in the Arthurian world. I came out saying WOW but my partner saying MEH... The biggest shame is that, with the low box office reception, any sequel will suck because they won't get the budget to deliver the same production quality. Guy, Joby, Lionel and Daniel (Soundtrack) you delivered a stunning, daring film and I thank you for that!",5
"  Great take on the story. Some was a bit confusing at first given the known story of who's involved, but the director turned what sounds like a bland movie into a really interesting one",5
  I liked it a lot. This movie really makes you hate Jude Law,5
"  While it offers some great moments here and there, King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword is one of those films where it not only marks a missed-opportunity for everybody involved, but this was also a dull and forgettable mess, and it's one of the worst movies of the summer and one of the worst films of 2017.",1
  I give this a 68/D+.,2
  I was very surprised. Was fast paced and fun. Totally new take on the story. Really enjoyed it.,4
"  it is obvious the paid critics are on someone's payroll, to pan this movie is ridiculous, this is a great story told very succinctly the time flows past you like a cool summer blockbuster should.",4
"  This CGI-driven mindless action fantasy bastardization of Arthurian legend did nothing so much as make me appreciate the Clive Owen-Keira Knightley effort more. While that movie largely missed, it at least tried at something worthwhile. This one just wasted my time.",1
  I didn't like anything about this movie.,0
  King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is an excellent introduction into what shall be a long running series of films based around King Arthur and his Camelot. Don't believe any of the negativity of this film. The film was a thrilling ride from start to end. Armchair critics will become a thing of the past just like Excalibur cutting through the iron shields of soldiers who dare stand in the way.

"  really enjoyed it at the cinema, does not deserve the poor critics.",4
"  I think rotten tomatoes do appalling reviews. your ""top critics"" time and time again fail to take a movie for what it is. King Arthur for example was an excellent depiction of the original story that was adapted for a modern audience, 75% of which liked the movie. this movie had an excellent soundtrack which paired well with each scene along with excellent acting and great directing. easily in the top 5 movies that i have seen.",5
"  I have to side with the critics on this one. The fast paced, fast talking, straight weird delivery left me uninterested. I left the theater before it finished.",1
"  Nothing special, but it was filmed well. Not necessary to see in the theater but would make a good relaxing night on the couch.",2
"  Ignore the critics its not as bad as the majority of them seem to think. I really think some of the pretentious and elitist critics should retire. Overall, a bit of crazy in parts but I enjoyed it",4
  this movies was a success here in norway you could barley find a ticket in the first week everyone including myself pre-reserved the seats 1 week before the movies release,5
"  Amazing soundtrack, fantastic dialogue and very well shot. One of my favourite films in a long time!",5
"  Movie critics are akin to Yelp critics, utterly irrelevant. The story of King Arthur is an amazing one. Action is the corner stone of Medieval warfare ya crusty old farts! I love how this movie adapts the new and the old, the music makes this movie legendary.",0
  hell of a movie! wasn't expecting much but was blown away!,5
  Very fun and enjoyable movie. I hope they make sequels.,4
"  Saw it last night, Awesome movie. Takes you from the beginning in a rollercoaster story.......go see it for yourself !!",5
  This movie was amazing I think every should go and watch this. Don't judge it before you see it.,5
"  Dreadful nonsense, who would have guessed that London in the Dark Ages had a Chinese dojo. Yes it is all that silly. And no Merlin or Guinevere",1
"  Pretty good movie, I'd see it again. Good sets and action scenes. Cgi at times was noticeably weird but easy enough to overlook if you want to",4
  Enjoyable retelling - predictably action packed but well filmed and lushly presented. Lock Stock set a millennium ago,4
  Style over substance.,2
  This movie action surprise me it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be,4
  Absolutely loved this film! It is a must see! If you don't appreciate great directing and acting this is not the film for you.,5
  better than expected. very entertaining!,4
  Terrible movie! They did not make us care for the characters nor did the story follow. Very painful movie to watch. It was a waste of time and money.,0
"  King Arthur gets the 'East End' Guy Ritchie treatment. Bonkers and surreal, but with a really impressive CGI serpent.",2
"  A Post Modern Masterpiece, Guy Ritchie hit it out of the ball park with this one. Unfortunately, this movie will have to wait until both critics and audiences appreciate itScenes evocative of ""Game of Thrones"" or ""Lord of the Rings"" seamlessly combined, 21st century character's attitudes and accents, creating a post modern version of an old myth.",5
  Well.... there is nothing wrong with this film. And the Guy Ritchie way of telling a story does lend itself well to this tale. It is just that it fell a little flat emotionally. I would mend seeing it. But do not go thinking you are seeing a classic....,2
"  Guy Ritchie patched together good days of filming and terrible days of filmingMovie does not flow evenly, and humor is contrived and forcedCritics were right for a change on this one!",1
  What. A. Movie. Do yourself a favor and see this before it's gone from the theater.,5
"  Just left the cinema after watching King Arthur, what a film! The acting was amazing, everything about it was amazing! Honestly don't understand why the critics have been so harsh, such a difference in the audience ratings in comparison. An amazing film, would definitely recommend.",5
  I think it's a good movie. So great music and easy story. Why you don't likes.,4
  Saw it in the movie theater and fell asleep through half of it.,1
  Not sure what all the hate is about for this movie. It was a fun watch.,4
  The best take on King Arthur since the classic Sword and the Stone!,5
"  Although the Arthur character was portrayed a little too ""GQ"" for that era....I thought all of the other characters were just great. The soundtrack matched w/ the action scenes was superb, and the story line was more than interesting. A good start of the summer movie extravaganza for me.I feel the critics missed this one.....I'd give it an 80% rating for an entertaining/interesting summer fantasy film!",4
"  This movie was amazing. As an avid King Arthur fan, I read, view or listen to everything I can find, this movie does the legend proud while still adding many original elements that fit as if they had always been a part of the story. I really don't understand the critics bad reviews except to think those critics have no imagination and they don't enjoy fun, exciting movies with a great cast.",5
  What an amazing twist on King Arthur. I highly recommend it. Guy Ritchie doesn't disappoint and the actors were amazing!!,5
"  We nearly gave this movie a pass due to the poor critic reviews, but after reading some of the audience reviews decided it was still worth a go. So glad we did. I absolutely love Lock Stock and most of Guy Ritchie's other works, and rate fantasy/legend as my favourite genre of storytelling. For me this movie was a wonderful fusion of both. You get that clever banter Ritchie's films are known for amongst some of the best fantasy scenes I've seen on the big screen. The characters are all superbly cast. The soundtrack is excellent. It has the King Arthur highlights you'd expect - a sword in a stone, a round table, the unlikely hero, with a few twists on the well-known legend. Yes, there's some overdone CGI, but by no means did it affect my enjoyment of the film. It's epic, witty, enjoyable movie watching at its best. If Lock Stock meets Lord of the Rings sounds like the kind of movie you would like to see, then what are you waiting for?",5
  Not sure if they should have added blood and gore to the movie or they should have gave the audience LSD as they entered the theater. It was not a bad movie just did not like how the director speed through every storyline scene. They just should have made the movie longer so they could tell the story in a proper manner.,1
"  Critics clearly wrong and cynical as always. This is a must see for anyone that enjoys solid, funny, action tales of adventure. Go see it...Pirates can't touch this.",5
"  I went to watch this because other movies were sold out, and I'm glad they were. I really thought this movie was pretty great. It's funny that the critics didn't like it, but it's highly liked by everyone else. Well, include me in that group. Quite a fun movie in my opinion.",4
  Spectacular film you will enjoy it,4
"  Great casting, great twist for the story! Even though I would definitely have liked more Merlin I think it's a definite win for Guy Ritchie!",4
"  Sadly, someone stopped Guy Ritchie from making it as ridiculous as he wanted it to be; instead it stops and starts into a superhero genre (bizarrely). Good points: lounging Jude Law, good soundtrack, the mage who could star in Tamora Pierce's Wildmage series and the incredibly charismatic Charlie Hunnam.",2
"  Again another representation of why I absolutely never pay attention to so called critics. This is easily one of the best movies I have seen in a while. Critics cry that there is not any character development all the time, yet when a movie is full of it, they cry about that. Other so called purist cry that it is a different story so it can't be good, I'm about a big a purist there is, but when your talking about any King Arthur Story there literally 100s of different versions, so why not add this one, instead of the played out depressing versions. Again critics cry that there isn't anything new created, yet when there is, they cry foul. I would give it A- and only gave it a minus because of to much character development. I think this movie would be a A+ with an additional half hour of play. Even my wife who knows absolutely nothing of Authorian legends, loved it.",5
"  50% ""Vikings"", 40% ""Snatch"", 10% ""Constantine""",4
"  I really enjoyed this movie. It was getting bad press months and months before it ever came out. With the cost of going to see a film that scares people off. Once again the critics opinion and mine was way off. It's to bad there won't be any sequels now because I, for one, would have seen them without question.",4
"  King Arthur is a film that expects us to take it seriously even though it doesn't do so itself. Instead of having a simple narrative flow, the film felt just a mixture of disconcerting & unsettled scenes, thrown together at the last minute. The tempo was all over the place & the theme often changes from epic to comedy to drama-crime to even a music video. Even Hunnam's performance can't liberate this dreadful mess of a film.",1
  walked out half way through. such a let down,0
"  The critics on this website and others have I think unfairly rated this movie. Here are some reasons why King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is actually a good movie and you should see it:- The cinematography is incredible. - The special effect are also incredible. The CGI is used smartly in this movie, and its blend with miniatures and live action works perfectly.- Daniel Pemberton did a phenomenal job with the soundtrack. Each piece has its place and carries the action as well as creating a symbiosis with the visuals.- Several of the wisest, most powerful, and most important characters are people of color. There is representation in this movie, and not discrimination or references are made to a character's skin color except for one small joke in the movie. (Which is funny because it is a true fact.)- One out of the top three most powerful characters in the entire film is female and is not demeaned at all by others on her side for being female.- Shows the main villain of the film actually showing grief and powerful feelings toward his own family. It creates a three dimensional villain that the audience can relate to, and Jude Law also gave a fantastic performance as the evil king Voltigern.- All pieces of lore about excalibur and the story is explained, nothing is left to speculation about how the sword ends up where it does. YES things have been changed from the original story, but in this movie all the changes are explain and accepted as facts, which for me was all that I needed to go along with it.This is a modern, high action interpretation of King Arthur's legend that lives to the expectation, because past the image of a mainstream blockbuster movie is actually touches on very important issues such as prostitution, PTSD, the responsibilities of a leadership roles and sacrifices.Please give this movie a change to amaze you.",4
"  Critics are being very harsh. This film is well written, has great action and acting. The effects are brilliant and the movie score is one of the best, up their with the greatest. The story is a fresh take on King Arthur and by far the best film version since Excalibur. I could watch this again and enjoy it just as much. My daughter loved it as well, so one for the kids and the parents. Go see it and let's hope this film gets the planned sequels it rightly deserves!",4
"  Honestly I thought it was better than Wonder Woman. It's definitely got that Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Gun feel and it's fun to watch for sure. At the very worst, it's two hours of Charlie Hunnam and that can't be all bad.",4
  Honestly I dont know why it got so much hate. You could tell the edit had been massage but overall a fun ritchie fil with a some emotion,4
"  I'm seeing this ""28%"" and thinking I'm the only sane person who actually saw this movie! CHANGE THAT 2 TO AN 8 AND YOU HAVE MY VOTE!!!This is a visual masterpiece, with an omfg amazing score and brilliant storytelling :DI laughed a lot, cried a lot (my god this movie hits the feels when it wants to).I had no idea Charlie Hunnam could pull off a performance like this... Please give this film some love because its being bashed by toffee nosed stuck up reviewers who don't know what a bold new take on something is!Please thats just make more Michael Bay movies where shit blows up and everything looks the same you half wits!",4
  Good movie sad it had terrible reviews.,4
  Sadly disappointing. A cross between an oddly juxtaposed gangster plot with cockney accents and a CGI crossover of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. Not great.,2
  I'm not sure why someone thought it was a good idea to do this reworking of the story.,2
  We though this was typical guy Richie style and loved it. Great cast. Well done!,4
"  Ignore the critics reviews, the movie was very entertaining, not a dull moment.",5
"  Good movie, but it left me with a ton of unanswered questions. The action was good, and the movie was humorous, but the beginning of the movie is weird and confusing. It took a good 30 minutes to get interesting. Didn't really meet my expectations. But I don't really think it was bad.",2
  Critics are mental. This movie was awesome! Score was great. Casting was well put together. Action was amazing. I went to go see an epic movie and they delivered!,5
  One of my favourite films this year. A really good storyline.,5
"  I've read the reviews of this movie, and I have to say that I disagree with it's critics. I loved it! It's what a spring/summer movie should be. It doesn't take itself too seriously and loads it's of fun. Will it win any Oscars, def not, but it's enjoyable and a cool take on an old story.",4
"  Critics are crap. If ur looking for historical... wrong movie. But if u dig stylistic action combined with awesome tunes & beautiful FX, this is your movie! Felt a bit short but a great, great watch!",5
  we all know the legend of King Arthur I've been in love with the lore since I was a kid this movie does a good job of standing out among the countless others I applaud this movie for showing Arthur hidden away and raised from humble beginnings the movie however seems to stray away from the Legend of it too much times and it comes as a disappointment that many of the more interesting characters in The Legend are barely touched upon at times it feels like a sophisticated crime movie disguised in Arthurian garb with a hint of Lord of the Rings here and there still the movie is very enjoyable and makes King Arthur a character that the viewer can relate to the lead actor is amazing and The Supporting Cast is equally as impressive hoping for a sequel as I would love to see the legend continue definitely buying this on Blu-ray and would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys the Arthurian Legend or a great action adventure film,4
"  Fantastic movie. Can't believe it got bad reviews. This movie had action from start to finish, dry comedy, and great acting. This was a super fun movie if someone didnt like it don't listen.",5
  I have no idea what is wrong with movie critics. Great movie! Great story! Great action!,4
  Great actors -- love it,5
"  As an avid Guy Ritchie fan this movie is typical to his style. It's enjoyable as a stand alone action movie, and is best held separate from the mythos of King Arthur. The dry wit and wry humor mask the drudgery of the world building the movie undertakes. I definitely plan on seeing it several more times while it's in theater.",5
"  I greatly enjoyed Guy's take on the King Arthur tale. The dramatic story line punctuated with well placed dry humor, his signature, was spot on. The absence of the romantic story line, usually brought to this story, allowed Guy to focus on the development of the main protagonist and thus increase the audiences investment in the story. It will be interesting to see where this goes from here.",4
"  Great action/fantasy movie. Guy Ritchie gives this movie a really unique feel: it's almost like a gang/mafia film in a fantasy setting. The only criticism I have is that (mild SPOILER) the smoke demon turns out to be something sort of boring, and that the final fight has too much obvious CGI.",5
  It was incredible. It had me hooked from the very start. It was quick witted and although it was packed with action the humor helped keep it light hearted.,5
"  Ugh, how do you screw up King Arthur this bad? So disappointing.",1
"  Loved this movie! Not stereotypical. Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I would have liked to get to know the characters a bit more, but only because I liked them so much. I hope they make another one. I want to know what happens next!",4
  blade meets matrix meets a knights tale!!!,4
  Great plot. Fun cinematography. Fast action. Typical Guy production. Hope for a sequel. The lack of attendance may be due to the subject matter. Medieval times no longer in? The renfaire was popular. Hmmm.,4
"  I really enjoyed this version of King Arthur. Lots of humor, great action scenes, excellent special effects, characters I cared about. Much better than many of the critically acclaimed movies out there. See this one if you truly want to be entertained. Sad that it didn't do well at the box office. Would have liked to have seen the other installments.",4
"  Surprisingly, I am very pleased with this movie.. Especially the soundtrack! it's amazing!!",4
"  Great action, wonderful actors, interesting story and only 1 profane word. Thank you Guy Ritchie. Loved the visuals.",5
  The glaring disparity between critics and audiences tells the story. Go see this movie...,5
"  Great movie !!! My favorite King Arthur movie by far. Full of action , comedy , and stunning visuals . I'm ?sure I'll watch it for years to come.",5
"  It was a great take on a classic. Well acted and enough action to keep your attention the whole movie. Had read the bad reviews and wasn't expecting much, but left the theater in a great mood and pleased that we had seen it.",5
"  Why pick on King Arthur, Guy? What'd he ever do to you, besides help define the hero-genre? Guy Ritchie makes a Frankenstein movie in which he breaks the bones of the Arthurian story (and time, space, linear narrative...) and reassembles the part into an extended dreamscape. Points for style, but it's a style that doesn't really have legs. It gets old quickly.I'm not religious or a purist, but once you drain the Christian virtues and philosophy from the Arthurian story, you might as well have come up with a generic hero from the job-lot of video-games or something. Calling it ""Arthur"" is just branding, and Ritchie fans should acknowledge that that's a little manipulative. It's not Arthur in any recognizable sense, if you just change the character-names.",1
"  I made an account just to say "" Whoever from Rotten Tomatoes is giving out those ratings, is a complete imbecile ( A person with moderate to severe intellectual disability having a mental age of from three to seven years and generally being capable of some degree of communication and performance of simple tasks under supervision) This movie was great! Action packed with British humor! Sure , not your Classic Arthur , knights of the round table Film, but it had everything you wanted for those 2 hours to keep you watching without moving in your chair.So, dear sirs that run this website - eat an apple and go put a rotten onion in your arse.",4
"  I'm a bit late to the game but.... You NEED to see this at the cinema. It's meant to be 1 of 6. The Americans didn't get it, they didn't spend their money. Because it's not In your face, instead it's.... Steady, strong, mystical, full of purpose, powerful,. It's gangster  It's Guy F-ing Richie, Its King Arthur.  It's LEGEND!",5
"  Perfect example of a movie in which the critics have absolutely no idea what they're talking about. Amazing movie. Entertaining, funny, impressive visuals and a great soundtrack. Highly recommended.",5
  A true King Arthur we all deserve but story lines could use refreshing,5
  Pity when you go expecting something and getting less that what you wished for.,2
"  Movie was amazing. Many action movie start slow, however this one kept the pace up all movie. Had you on the edge of your seat the whole time",5
"  I enjoyed every second of it, even if some fight scenes where a bit blurry, I still had a blast, and I wasn't expecting so much humor, it was a very pleasant surprise. Jude Law's acting is as always impressive, his portrayal of pain towards the end really caught me by surprise.",5
  Go into it with an open mind and it's a great movie. Fun action with good acting and great cgi.,4
  Ingore the critics if you love themes like this. Critics are unless. They usually love movies that suck and hate movies that are good. I loved loved this movie. Charlie was awesome Ã°??? awesome Ã°??? Ã°??? Ã°??? Ã°??? Ã°???,5
"  Spectacular effects, obviously lots of money thrown at it, however ,early in the movie the dialogue deteriorates rapidly from banal, to absolute 'naff' excruciatingly bad wisecracks , I was almost waiting for them to break into song or rhyme ! God knows what kind of audience this crap was aimed at.I was relieved when it finally finished, I was looking forward to leaving and having a good meal somewhere . If you're looking for any of the original story you may well be disappointed.",1
  This movie was EXCELLENT! We really wish that we would have seen it in 3D but it wasn't available at our theater! I was just going to see Charlie Hunnam but the movie itself turned out to be really rate great! I think one of the reasons why it did not get the rating it should have gotten was that the previews were hardly advertising the movie on television and radio Etc!! Charlie Hunnam should have been on more programs like Jimmy Kimmel Etc way before what he was on! Guy Ritchie also!If you liked The Tolkien and other such movies you would have absolutely loved this movie! It was action-packed and had great visual Parts in it that really kept it moving! Such a shame and such a bad review for such a great actor!,5
"  Ignore the critics. This is the best King Arthur film since Excalibur. Great acting, pace, story. Acting is brilliant throughout especially the lead actor and the music is amazing. Go see it.",5
"  The critics are idiots. This movie was fun to watch, and very entertaiming. Who cares about plot holes in the fantasy genre? It's a myth, you pompous, fastidious jerks. This movie was a refreshing take on a worn-out legend. And stylishly done! Everyone in the theater was entertained at the viewing I attended.",4
"  Went to the cinema expecting a cluck... Went out believing in heroes all over again !!! The movie's pace is excellent action upon action... Those small comical minutes are great... But the action... OMG !!! Every hero deserves a villain an yes... Its a great villain indeed... The mythology of a dark world , magic and swordfight is there.... Felt the same goosebumps as when i saw Lord Of The Rings... But King Arthur is less talk.. More Do... Love to see such an assemble of faces recognized from other series... Truly think deserves a 90+ rating and confirms to me that not always the critics are right ...",4
  C'était énorme! Merci.,5
"  This movie offered something new and intriguing, with it's fun and intriguing cinematography, fantastic soundtrack by Daniel Pemberton, and quirky dialogue, King Arthur broke the status quo and was a lovely surprise.",4
  ROTTEN TOMATOES PROVES IT'S NAME SAKE. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT MOVIE TO GO SEE. LOOK FOR THE MOVIE WITH THE WORST RATINGS.,0
  supernice movie with cool cameratrics and montage...,5
  Get your heads out of your Butts and open your minds...This movie was never meant to be part of Legends stop comparing to past King Arthur's..It's fanasty people,4
  This movie is amazing!! т?дт?дт?д,5
"  I don't understand why most critic reviews were so bad. I am a 50 year old woman who doesn't think many movies are good enough to see in a theater. But trailers for this movie got me so excited that I bought tickets for me and my son a week ahead of time and I paid a lot extra for Dbox and 3D. We loved every minute of the movie, and I can't wait to see it again at home so I can rewind parts that go by too quickly or were especially entertaining. I really hope it makes enough money for sequels to be made!",4
  Yet another movie mad to sell happy meal toys. Same tired theme good guy reluctant hero is almost beaten befor he calmly overcomes impossible odds. The action is for kindergarteners and the entire thing is outlandish in a power rangers kind of way. It reduces legend to unbeleavability in the same fashion as Noah. Did I mention it's just plain corney? Almost like it was directed by the boyfriend of some crazy singer.,1
  One of the best movies I have seen this year.,5
  Absolutely loved this movie. Probably best one I have seen so far this year.,5
  Awesome. If you liked Sherlock Holmes you'll love his rendition of King Arthur. Don't listen to the boring negative critics.,5
  King Arthur: Legend of the Sword was a great movie and awesome me and my friend Andrew liked it.,4
"  Nice flick, don't get all the hate. I guess they didn't pay rotten tomatoes as much as john wick did.",5
  I liked it. but the visual stuff was a little weird. but it was a good story.,4
  Completely and absolutely AWE-mazing!!!! Action packed from start to finish!!! I love the Arthurian legend and Guy Ritchie definitely puts a whole different twist on it without losing the legend as we know it. This movie is filled with A+ actors who don't disappoint.,5
"  Great acting, story written well and it had enough action to keep all audiences on the edge of their seat. I would recommend seeing it!",5
"  FUNNIEST, TOP BEST 2017 MOVIE SO FAR.. FULL OF ACTION & GREAT CAST !!!",5
  I was bored to tears.,1
"  Screw the critics! This was tons of fun to watch! Over the top tolkein style, awesome score! Worth the price of admission. Very very pleased with this flick. Hail king Arthur!",4
"  I have Not Seen the movie yet,but I Want To........I Love Charlie Hunnam,there is absolutely NO WAY, it's as Bad as people are saying......___.I___ know ___I would love it, Not to mention it's got other Very Good Actors.......:p.....C.Hunnam/JAX is a BAD ASS,when he's in a movie or show,he Gives it his all.........that's all you can ask for.......FAN FOR LIFE......",5
  I love this movie!!! I've seen it twice already! Critics got this all wrong!,5
  This movie is exceptionally good! The plot and the actors were fantastic.,0
"  Seems that Guy Ritchie is the go-to director to give old-fashioned properties a (questionably) needed English gangster aesthetic-an aesthetic that made himself a household name with 1998s Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and 2000s Snatch. After successfully pulling this trick off with 2009s Sherlock Holmes (and the 2011 sequel) and the underrated 2015 espionage action-comedy The Man From U.N.C.L.E. (best not talk about his Madonna-starring remake of 2002s Swept Away), the British director has now implemented his quick-cut, fast-talking style into a property that is dear to his homeland with 2017s King Author: Legend of the Sword, a film that has way too much going on but is ultimately a satisfying, fun, experience non-the-less. Much credit should be given to Ritchie for not only doing something completely different with material that would (most likely) be done exactly how one would assume if another filmmaker were at the helm but still make a story so old feel new, unique and revitalized. With a screenplay that gets the best out of Ritchie's kinetic way of storytelling (written by Lionel Wigram, Joby Harold and Ritchie), the pace of the film is unrelenting with a ton of information thrown at you but the engagement level never deters even when giant bats, giant elephants and giant snakes spill over the frames. With a huge dose of weird (Ritchie indulges in visual extravagance one wouldn't expect from the filmmaker), a huge dose of momentum (this film never lets up-with a great score from John Mathieson to keep things ticking) and a huge dose of (escapist) entertainment, King Author: Legend of the Sword is a worthy retelling of such an old tale, proving Ritchie's inspired, singular pedigree with updating older properties.",4
"  Not exactly sure what the deal is with the critics. They must still be mad over Madonna and Guy Ritchie splitting back in the day. Ignore the critics, the movie is awesome. Entertaining, fresh and in perfect Guy Ritchie style, the story, music and effects were great. Let us not forget his other fantastic movies like Sherlock Holmes, Snatch, Man from U.N.C.L.E etc. I'm going to go vote with my wallet again this week and see it again.",5
"  Excellent, fantastic this movie, the history of the movie is good, the action scenes are very good, one of the best scenes of the movie is the scene that Arthur pull the sword of the stone, another scene that is good is the fight between Arthur and Vortigern. The style of Guy Ritchie works very well. The visual effects of the movie are good, the movie has a good 3D. The actors play there roles very well, mainly Charlie Hunnam and Jude Law. I loved this movie. This movie is one of the best of the year.",5
"  To be honest, I wasn't interested in seeing this movie. However when I was looking for something to see on an impromptu boys night with my 13yo, this was the best option. Although after going I will say that this is one of the most fun times I've had at a movie in awhile. I will agree with allot of the critics in that this is a familiar story that has been interpreted better, and often. However that is not what Guy Ritchie is going for, this is just meant to be a fun Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels set in Arthurian times. The movie moves at a pace that makes the running time very deceptive. The visuals are a melding of Frazetta, Tolkien, and Excalibur. The acting is sufficient, Jude Law is a little over the top, but in a good way, and Hunnam brings a little bit of Jax in his Arthur, but it fits the character. Unfortunately, I believe that the legend that created the following and funding for this film, may also be it's downfall. In this day and age I don't believe that very many are asking for or wanted another King Arthur story, that could have easily been set in an original fantasy world. Which is unfortunate, because this is a fun film that returns Guy Ritchie to his root style, and should be seen by all who can suspend disbelief, and just enjoy a fun action movie.",4
"  I loved this film so all the complainers can shove it! lol And I have never seen Sons of Anarchy so it's nothing to do with that, I just really loved the film and think Guy Ritchie did an excellent updated version of the story.",4
"  Loved this movie. Shocked that so many critics gave it poor reviews. I honestly am not sure why the movie got so low reviews. It was a fantastic film with wonderful blends of action and humor. I would love to see a sequel, but based on the reviews and low box office numbers, I am not sure if we will see one; at least not one of the same caliber. Great movie!",4
  Thoroughly entertaining through and through.,5
"  I truly cannot understand why so many People do not like this movie. To me, it was (admittedly, a bit unexpected) very entertaining and definitely worth my while. In my opinion, the Marketing for this movie was not very good, at least in Europe, which might explain the bad box office outcome. Both Jude Law and Charlie Hunnam did a good job, the music was really fitting and I did like this movie.",5
  We almost didn't watch this because the reviews seemed low. Watched it with my sons...blew us away. GREAT!! Sometimes movies seem to be up against unfair criticism yet are SOOO GOOD while others are toted as a must see but are very mediocre. I think it's political. This is a great movie.,5
"  It certainly was a Guy Ritchie movie. I think the previews really did the movie some injustice - it came off as LoTR-esque, but the movie was far from it. Yes the camera was quick, lots of cut aways, and you had to pay attention to the story. It was a Guy Ritchie movie lol. I enjoyed this rendition of Arthur, gritty and mystical, it stayed true to the mythos.",4
  I loved everything about it. Guy Ritchie made this classic story his own & put a new twist on everything that I thought was great. The humor t & personality hat was thrown in was awesome & I also loved the musical score,0
  Takoe sebe na odin raz.,2
"  Good film. Worth the watch. The fact London exists is a little odd, but it is interesting take on a classic myth, so hell why not.",4
"  Absolutely LOVED this movie!! What a breath of fresh air!! Thank you Guy Richie and all the cast and crew for making such a great film! Soooo much better than many of the other films that are getting better reviews. I don't know what people's deal is, this is a GREAT movie. Finally an entertaining film actually worth seeing!!",5
"  Pretty Dreadful, especially if you are familiar with the story and/or the period. Excalbur has ""powers"" like the Ark of the Covenant in Raiders. The king is a brothel-raised pickpocketing street fighter - somehow this has given the drive to act as a king, although he is pretty much pushed into it and wouldnt have succeeeded without the aid of a female mage. Though the basic story is well-known, somehow a character named Vortigen comes into it whereas Arthur's half-brother Mordred is a bad wizard in this mess. It is set in approximately 400-500 AD but one character has a telescope, which was invented in 1608. The ""good guys"" say that two gates are 3 minutes away, but there were no clocks until 400 years ago. Some architectural styles are Roman or early medieval but there are pillows and windows from about 1200-1300. Immense buildings borrowed from the Lord of the Rings; big snakes from Harry Potter. This is what happens with a generation of movie-makers who grew up watching movies and TV instaed of reading books with plots. Bernard Cornwell and Jack Whyte, among others, have written good modern vresion of the Arthurian legend. The movie does have a lot of big buildings collapsing, lightening bolts travelling through stone buildings, and guys with armour, some of which appears to be held together with Velcro.",0
"  I thought it was a great movie. I'm wondering if those who don't like it are from a different generation? I'm in my 30s and love action, can appreciate the historical flare (though it's not intended to be historically accurate in anyway, as the story itself is a legend), and I like the characters. I felt endeared to them. I also thought the acting was great and the movie well cast, I also thought the special effects were good. So... I'm all for it. Haters gonna hate.",5
